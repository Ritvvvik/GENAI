    "text": "Media playback is not supported on this device\nIt's 1997 and ID7 television are filming at Dunkirk rugby club in northern France. Their subject is in his mid-30s, has a full head of hair and is strangely familiar. He's not French, but he's fluent. Only when the cameraman asks him to say his name does the penny drop.\n\"Je m'appelle Vernon Anthony Cotter.\"\nFor four and a half minutes he doesn't miss a beat - and why would he? Cotter had been in the country for years by then. Four seasons playing in the back row with Rumilly in the south-east, two years with Lourdes in the foothills of the Pyrenees, a year with Saint-Junien in west-central France and he would soon kick on for the small southern village of Castelnau-Riviere-Basse, where he played and coached while briefly contemplating a new life as a winemaker.\nCotter is now sitting in Murrayfield talking about the past, the present, the future. The New Zealander has been Scotland coach for 31 Test matches - 16 victories, 15 defeats, nine of which were by seven points or less, five of them by three or less.\nHe's given a first cap to 26 players. Eighteen of the squad he has just named for the Six Nations have appeared on his watch.\nHe has just five more Tests before France reclaims him. Montpellier await. Time for reflection, then. Time to remember where Cotter came from and where he has taken Scotland in his two and a half eventful years.\nCotter is big into culture. Rugby culture. He learned about it first as a player with Counties in New Zealand but a lot of his knowledge came in those early years in France. \"I used to think I was a reasonably physical player, but I was a baby,\" he says.\nI understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here\n\"I learned a lot about character and defending the jersey. You couldn't help but get swept away. The French flair - I used to laugh at that. It wasn't true. Overlaps were created because two forward packs were generally having a good whack at each other.\"\nHe tells a story about a derby match from the mid-90s, his own Lourdes team versus Pau. No love lost between them. In their previous meeting there'd been \"scuffles\" and Lourdes had come off second best.\n\"Our players were doing cartwheels going on to the paddock,\" Cotter recounts. \"The coach said, 'Right boys, tactics for the day. The first five [eighth] kick it straight into the stand and we run up and punch them.' That's what happened. I had somebody who had given me a gentle tickle in the away game and I managed to line him up.\n\"There was an all-out brawl, but no penalty. We had a scrum in midfield and our locks came through and caressed the opposition front row a little bit with their hands. A couple of them needed treatment and we scored a try from there. It was an insight.\n\"It wasn't just a game. I enjoyed the fact that you were playing for your town and your colours. They could be absolute psychopaths on the paddock and gentlemen afterwards.\"\nYears later, while coaching at Clermont, Cotter was given a nickname - les yeux de glace ('eyes of ice'). Years after that, in Scotland, he was christened Stern Vern. To understand what makes him tick, the period of his life in a country where he's already done 17 years, and where he will soon return for another three, is important.\nEight seasons at Clermont turned Cotter into one of the hottest coaching tickets in world rugby. The season before he took over, the club finished a poor eighth in the French championship. In his first year - and for the three years that followed - they made the final.\nIn 2010 they won the first league title in their history. Cotter - with his great friend Joe Schmidt as assistant coach - had become immortal in the French game.\nClermont were never out of the top four on Cotter's watch. Then, the move to Scotland. Not a lot of people in France could understand why he did it. Going to New Zealand, they would have understood. England, they could get. Ireland, perhaps. But Scotland?\n\"It's something that I didn't have to do, it's something that we wanted to do as a family,\" he explains.\n\"One of the key motivating factors was that people [in France] would take the mickey out of Scotland and its rugby. It sort of upset me. I was defending the underdog.\n\"Before the Six Nations, everybody would take a sweepstake and Scotland was always last pick.\n\"Look, I remember the 1990s. I remember Scotland coming to New Zealand [in the summer of 1990] and they should have beaten the All Blacks. We weren't inventing the game, Scotland were doing it. When we first came together as a squad we looked at some footage of those days. They were brave, confident warriors.\n\"Trying to bring that back to Scotland was one of the key things. They [Jim Telfer and Ian McGeechan, the coaches of the era] were ahead of their time. Any comparison to those two great men is very nice. I would take inspiration from what they did. The game has moved on but some of the essential things they were coaching are still relevant, especially to the Scottish psyche.\n\"Scotland has a proud history. It's a humble country and it's a place you can become attached to very quickly.\"\nIn Cotter's first Six Nations, in 2015, Scotland got whitewashed, Wooden-spooned and, at times, embarrassed. Last season brought progression. The brilliance and pain of the near-miss against Australia in the World Cup, the home win against France in the Six Nations, the fact - incredible as it seems - that 2016 was the first time in the 17-year history of the competition that Scotland managed to score more points than they conceded, and hit double figures for tries scored.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nScotland have become an exciting team. More than at any point since last winning the championship under Telfer in 1999, they're posing a threat to the big nations.\n\"The principal foundations are mindset and skill-set,\" says Cotter. \"It was about creating clarity.\n\"The other thing is leadership, creating a leadership group so that they determine behaviour and standards because it's always much easier when you have a group that can think on its feet, that's autonomous. I think that's where we're getting.\n\"You've got a team that's experienced some good things and some bad things. We've become aware of what we can do. Winning is the most important thing. So how do we win? We go through a painful process of learning how to win.\n\"There's been improvement. Would we have liked quicker improvement? Yeah, we probably would. Would we have liked to nail some of those close games? Yes. But we've used them as benchmarks.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nOn the opening day of the Six Nations, Ireland come to Edinburgh. \"We played them at the end of the competition in the last two years and their strength in depth showed through,\" Cotter recalls.\n\"We have more depth now to stay a bit more robust until the end. I'd like to think this game will be closer than those two.\n\"It's a really big challenge for our guys. Joe [Schmidt, Ireland coach] is a really good friend and we'll probably have a beer afterwards. Unfortunately, he's always the one with the smile on his face - and I'd like it to stop. I'd like to get one back on him.\"\nBeyond that, it's a trip to France, then a visit from Wales, then a journey down to England. Scotland have moved forward, but that's no guarantee of victories in the coming weeks.\n\"We know that these teams are very good,\" he insists. \"When they see us on the fixture list they know they're going in as favourites, very confident that they'll beat us. It's our job to try to surprise them somehow, to have something that will take them away from the comfort zone and create errors in their game that we can exploit.\"\nFive more games and then he's away. It's not the way he planned it. It's just the way it is, he says.\nWhen the news broke that this was going to be Cotter's final Six Nations, an audible gasp could have been heard around Scottish rugby. There had been little hint of it, no suggestion his time was coming to an end.\nHe would have preferred to stay on, but Gregor Townsend was ready for an elevation and there was only one way that was going to happen.\nWill he miss it? \"Undoubtedly, but we'll come back on holiday,\" he says. \"You never know, you might find that Glasgow are in Montpellier's pool next year in European rugby.\n\"It was always going to be the deal. The SRU had made it known at the outset that they'd like a Scottish coach in the national position sooner or later and I respect entirely the decision. Would I have liked to continue? Yeah, probably would have, but that's the way it is.\"\nCotter, without doubt, has been good for Scotland but he says Scotland has been good for him, too.\n\"I understand New Zealanders so much more after living in Scotland because a lot of the influence comes from here,\" he explains. \"I recognise it in our rural communities.\n\"I'm not an extroverted person - I'm introverted, I'm quiet - and I love the countryside, I love what Scotland has got to offer, whether it's the coastline, the mountains, the rivers. I enjoyed my time in Colonsay, fishing on the west coast in Plockton, stalking in Glen Shiel.\n\"We've got some good friends in the Borders who love their rugby and it's nice to see their passion. They talk about passion in France, but there's some real passion here for the game.\n\"It's been a privilege, the whole thing. I've only got fond memories. I move on. The game has existed in this country for over a hundred years and it will exist long after I've left. There's another project to move to after I finish here. We were going to go back to New Zealand but then Montpellier came up. They wanted something constructed and the communication I had with the president convinced me that there was perhaps another adventure to take on.\"\nMore than anything he wants to exit on a high. In the coming weeks he says he wants the team to deliver moments that will bond them together not just in the here and now but for decades down the road.\n\"They give everything, these guys,\" he adds. \"They're striving to give people something to be proud of. The stadium is a sell-out for Ireland. So, game on...\"",

    "text": "The biggest Commons clash is likely to be over Sunday trading  - where a well organised group of Tory rebels looks set to line up with Labour, to try to strike down proposals to loosen restrictions. The SNP look likely to be the swing vote in this particular debate.\nElsewhere, there's a new and multi-faceted crime bill, and in the Lords there's some preliminary sparring over the Trade Union Bill. There may also be votes on the Immigration Bill. But it looks as if the Commons-Lords \"ping-pong\" on the proposals to reform Employment Support Allowance for some disabled people may be petering out.\nHere's my rundown of the week ahead:\nThe Commons opens at 2.30pm for Education questions. As usual any post weekend ministerial statements or urgent questions will follow at 3.30pm.\nThen it's the launch of the Policing and Crime Bill, a wide-ranging measure which will:\nIn the Lords (2.30pm) after the usual hour of questions to ministers, it's the latest stage of the parliamentary ping-pong over the Welfare Reform and Work Bill. After MPs rejected a Lords amendment for the second time, it's rumoured peers may drop their resistance to the Commons over benefits for disabled people in the \"Work Related Activities Group\", and content themselves with a \"regret\" motion. Then peers debate the Tax Credits (Income Thresholds and determination of Rates) Regulations 2016 - where the Lib Dems have put down another \"regret motion\" but seem unlikely to attract Labour support.\nAnd that's followed by an International Women's Day debate on the progress of women's representation and empowerment in the UK, 150 years after the 1866 petition for women's suffrage. There are 27 peers down to speak, including two notable maidens - the Conservative Baroness Mone and the Bishop of Gloucester, Rachel Treweek, who will become the first woman Bishop to speak in the Lords.\nThe Commons opens (11.30am) with Justice questions, followed at 12.30pm by a Ten Minute Rule Bill from the Conservative, Will Quince. He's calling for a first aid component to be added to the driving test, continuing the backbench campaign for more first aid training which recently saw a private member's bill which attempted to require First Aid to be taught in schools.\nHe says this would substantially increase the number of Britons with knowledge of first aid - countries like Germany, Switzerland and the Czech Republic already require evidence of first aid training as a condition of having a full driving licence. Mr Quince claims the support of the British Red Cross and St John's Ambulance.\nAfter that, MPs turn to detailed consideration of the Enterprise Bill - Labour and the Green MP Dr Caroline Lucas both have amendments down on the proposed privatisation of the Green Investment Bank, set up under the Coalition; Labour want to preserve its environmental objectives in the private sector, while Dr Lucas wants buyers to commit themselves to maintaining its existing programme.\nAnd there is a series of amendments on the bill's proposal to cap redundancy payments for public sector workers.\nThere will also be a backbench debate to mark International Women's Day, led by the former Cabinet Minister Maria Miller, now chair of the Women and Equalities Committee - the motion calls for more progress in electing women to Parliament, pay parity between men and women and more action against FGM.\nIn Westminster Hall, the opening debate led by the SNP's Dr Lisa Cameron is on puppy farming and the welfare of young dogs bred for sale (9am-11am).  Then Labour's Jo Cox raises the issue of autism diagnosis waiting times - she says many parents are waiting over two years to get an autism diagnosis for their child and says the families should have a diagnosis within a reasonable timeframe.\nAnd at 2.30pm-4pm, the Conservative Simon Hart will lead a debate on the potential economic benefits of the Swansea Tidal Lagoon - a \u00c2\u00a31bn green energy project, which is one of several such schemes proposed along the south coast of Wales. He will seek to explore the likely impact on the local economy and the number of permanent jobs created in Wales - especially if the Newport and Cardiff Schemes come on line. Early predications refer to a \u00c2\u00a320bn inward investment, nearly 2,000 new jobs and an unquantifiable impact on tourism and leisure.\nIn the Lords (2.30pm) there's an International Woman's Day flavour to question time, with questions on: the UN framework preventing violence against women, gender inequality, discriminatory practices and harmful cultural and social norms, from Baroness Kinnock; improving the reading skills of 16 to 24-year-old women, from Baroness Rebuck and on increasing the representation of women in political and public life, from Baroness Gale.\nThen peers turn to the detail of the Housing and Planning Bill - in the fourth day of seven of committee stage - and already the debate is lagging well behind schedule, raising the prospect that the bill might not get to its report stage immediately after Easter, as planned.\nThe sections under scrutiny on Tuesday include right to buy for tenants of housing association properties and high value council property sales. This is the a contentious part of the bill - but, as usual, committee stage debates are preliminary sparring, and no votes are expected; but the debates will foreshadow amendments for report stage, when a serious attempt to re-write these provisions looks likely.\nThere will also be a short debate on a political solution to the civil war in Syria- led by the Bishop of Coventry.\nThe Commons meets at 11.30am - for half an hour of questions to the ministers at the Cabinet Office, the government's \"engine room,\" followed, at noon by questions to the prime minister.\nPlaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts has a Ten Minute Rule Bill calling for the law on cyber-crime to be brought together from around 30 different statutes, and for new duties to be imposed on internet service providers and social media companies, to remove offensive material.\nShe has cross party support and this looks very much like the start of a campaign, rather in the tradition of her predecessor, Elfyn Llywd, who scored significant success in toughening up the law on stalking.\nThen MPs move on to the detail of the Enterprise Bill - where the crunch vote will be on an amendment, spearheaded by Tory backbencher David Burrowes, and signed by 22 Conservatives, to delete the government's proposals to loosen restrictions on Sunday trading.\nLabour will be whipped to back it, the Northern Ireland DUP is on board - but it looks as if the SNP will not be. There's also an amendment from the former Cabinet Minister Caroline Spellman which would allow a limited relaxation in Sunday opening hours for larger shops.\nThe day's Westminster Hall debates cover BT service standards (9.30am-11am); the government's proposals on fixed recoverable costs in clinical negligence claims (11am-11.30am); the contribution of the Scotch whisky industry to the UK economy (2.30pm-4pm); the management of the Health and Safety Executive (4pm- 4.30pm) and competition in the UK energy market (4.30-5.30pm).\nIn the Lords (3pm) peers launch into the report stage of the Immigration Bill, where votes are expected on amendments dealing with overseas domestic workers and permission to work for asylum seekers. Watch out, too, for an amendment from Lords Alton and Forsyth, and Baroness Cox, to guarantee asylum for people fleeing genocide, as defined in the International Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of Genocide; and from Lord Dubs, to allow for asylum for people employed by the UK Government in Iraq or Afghanistan.\nThe really big clash over this bill, on unaccompanied child migrants, will come the following week - unless the government makes a pre-emptive concession.\nThere will be a lot of interest on the debate on the report from the special committee set up to examine the impact on trade union political funds and (Labour) party funding (the Burns Report, after the crossbench peer who chaired the committee).\nThe Committee suggested a number of fixes which would reduce the impact of the current proposals in the Trade Union Bill - which have been denounced as a partisan attack by the government on Labour.\nThis will be the first chance to debate them and to get a response from ministers. And the committee report will tee up a series of amendments when the bill comes to report stage, on Wednesday 16 March. Opposition parties are waiting to see the colour of the minister's money on this issue - but even if the government signs up to the Burns Report compromise, there's still plenty left in this bill to argue about - not insisting on postal ballots and allowing e-voting for union ballots, the \"check-off\" system for deducting union subs from pay-packets, facility time for union reps and much more.\nThe various sides are still circling each other and we could still see a long drawn-out bout of trench warfare when report stage commences.\nThe Commons opens (9.30am) with Transport questions, followed by the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Chris Grayling. He will be under considerable pressure to announce the dates of forthcoming parliamentary recesses, and of the next Queen's Speech. MPs are particularly keen to know whether there will be a recess covering the EU Referendum and whether the the start of the next parliamentary year will be put back until after the referendum, implying a State Opening ceremony in July.\nThen MPs turn to the report stage and third reading of the Northern Ireland (Stormont Agreement and Implementation Plan) Bill 2015-16, which implements the latest deal on the powers of the Northern Ireland Assembly. The scheduling implies that the powers that be don't expect any great controversy over this measure, and that the debate will be fairly brief.\nThe decision to end the centuries-old practice of recording Acts of Parliament on vellum - treated cow skin - will be raised in a Backbench Business Committee debate. James Gray, a member of the House of Commons Commission, which signed up to that decision (which came from the Lords) wants to carry on using vellum - and it may all come down to how much it would cost to keep it, and who pays.\nIn the Lords (from 11am) peers debate the detailed provisions on \"pay to stay\" and ending secure tenancies, in the Housing and Planning Bill (see Tuesday, above).\nThere will also be a short debate on the renewal of the BBC's Charter, led by the Liberal Democrat Baroness Bonham-Carter. As I write there are 16 peers are down to speak, which is quite a turnout for a short debate on a Thursday - suggesting there's a considerable level of interest in this issue in the Upper House.\nThe Commons meets (9.30am) to debate private members' bills - I'll list what's down on the Order Paper at the moment, but it's an increasingly inaccurate guide to what actually happens on the day. The main reason for this is that we're now approaching the end of the parliamentary year, where cunning operators like the wily Peter Bone angle to get second reading debate on issues they want to raise - although they then have little prospect of becoming law.\nBut the announcement of the date of the EU referendum has put Mr Bone, one of the prime movers in the increasingly important Grassroots Out organisation, into campaign mode, and he has not been able to be in the Chamber to move some of the many bills he has put down for debate.\nHis close ally, Christopher Chope, has stepped into the breach to move some of those bills - specialising in the ones with an EU dimension. But sadly we're unlikely to get a debate on the Prime Minister (Temporary Appointment) Bill, which would have provided a mechanism, in case the PM was run over by a bus.\nFor the record, the current batting order is:  Foreign National Offenders (Exclusion from the UK) Bill (Peter Bone); National Health Service Bill (Caroline Lucas); Criminal Cases Review Commission (Supplementary Powers) Bill (Andy McDonald); Regulation of Enforcement Agents (Collection of Council Tax Arrears) Bill (Yvonne Fovargue); Health Services Commissioning (Equality and Accountability) (No. 2) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Perinatal Mental Illness (NHS Family Services) Bill (Rehman Chishti); Scotland Act 1998 (Amendment) Bill (Angus Brendan MacNeil) and the House of Lords (Parliamentary Standards Etc) Bill (Sir Edward Leigh).\nThere are many more bills listed, and if some of those above are not moved, they may even be debated - if their movers are there to do so.\nIt's also private members' bill day in the Lords (10am) where peers will consider the Gambling (Categorisation and Use of B2 Gaming Machines) Bill and the Criminal Cases Review Commission (Information) Bill. More bills may be added to this list.",
    "summary": "I'm not sure we're quite into \"zombie Parliament\" territory, but there's a distinct lull in Westminster this week, as major events like the Budget and the Investigatory Powers Bill, loom on the horizon."

    "text": "Students earlier this summer took a total of 35,537 exams.\nBut what do we know about how well Wales is doing? How many students are going to university? And what happens next for those still with big decisions to make?\nMAKING THE GRADE\nA new top grade, A*, was introduced in 2010. A total of 6.6% achieved this in 2016, a fall on last year and still short of the UK average of 8.1%.\nThe proportion of students getting A* and A also fell again from 23.1% to 22.7% and Wales continues to trail the rest of the UK and all regions of England apart from the North East of England.\nWhen you look at individual subjects, more students in Wales have been getting top grades in maths over the last five years than in England - but in English language, Wales has been trailing, with the gap still 3.2% in the latest set of results.\nIn French, 31% got A* to A in Wales - this is an improvement, but 37.8% managed that in England. The gap was as wide as 14% in 2012. Numbers of students taking French have also gone down by 11% this year.\nWales and England are a little further apart now at the top grades for A-level physics, with Wales dropping back to 25.8% behind England on 29.6%.\nIt is worth looking too at how many students are only getting the lower grades.\nA slightly higher proportion in Wales - 23.5% - got D and E grades, compared to 20.6% in England. That gap has also widened slightly too.\nWales has more students getting these lower grades in English (23.2%) than who managed A* to A (15.9%) in the same subject.\nThere is also a more students getting D and E grades in French in Wales than in England for most of the last six years.\nDavid Evans, secretary of NUT Wales, said A-levels were the first time students specialised in subjects and it was important the quality of education and teaching was there.\n\"We need to look at the numbers who get  A* and celebrate them, and those who get As, Bs and Cs too,\" he said.\n\"We need to make sure we have a clear focus on those who achieve the grades they need for university and makes sure support is there for those who go on to do other things as well.\"\nOn the question of whether A-levels are getting easier, Phil McTague, head teacher of Ysgol Eirias in Colwyn Bay said: \"If Usain Bolt sets a new record in the hundred metres, people don't say the hundred metres is getting easier!  Our students have worked really hard this year and we're proud of all their results.\"\nHOW DOES WALES COMPARE WITH ENGLISH REGIONS?\nFor the first time last year, we were able to compare Wales' results with regions of England on the day they were published.\nWales has the lowest percentage of A*-C grades of any area - 73.8- including every English region.\nIt also has the lowest for A* and A - apart from the North East of England, which is now lower than Wales.\nWHAT IS THE PERFORMANCE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOYS AND GIRLS?\nGirls continue to outperform boys overall in Wales, with 97.9% of entries by girls this year gaining A* to E grades, compared to 96.5% of boys.\nAt the A* grade, the performance of boys was marginally better than that of girls, with 6.7% of boys and 6.5% of girls gaining A* - both improving since 2013.\nYou can also see performance differences between boys and girls for the top grades within subjects - as well as a difference in subjects chosen. The likes of physics and computing are very male dominated compared to French, English and Welsh at the other end of the scale.\nGareth Pierce, chief executive of the WJEC exam board, said some of the patterns were long standing \"and a natural feature\".\nWhy do more girls go to university?\nHOW MANY STUDENTS APPLY FROM WALES?\nThere were 23,740 students from Wales applying to universities in the UK this year - and with many looking at more than one university, this meant a total of 40,010 applications to Ucas.\nThere is very little difference in the number of students from Wales applying to university over the last few years.\nMore than half a million students got higher education places in the UK last year - three quarters of those who applied. These included 20,500 students from Wales, a 1.7% rise and a new high, while 87.5% of 18-year-olds from Wales who applied got places.\nOf those 18-year-old students who applied to Welsh universities, 84% got an offer, while 75% of Welsh applicants to English universities got an offer.\nAlthough there is a lot of attention at schools on results day - only around half of those entering university are 18-year-olds; others take gap years while the number of students over 26 is rising again.\nBy the end of Thursday, Ucas said 17,510 students from Wales had places in higher education - more than at the same time over the last five years.\nSTILL, MORE 18-YEAR-OLDS ARE GOING TO UNIVERSITY\nWales recorded its highest entry rate - 28.2% of all 18-year-olds got higher education places through Ucas in 2015 - although that is behind England on 31.3%.\nWales has had one of the lowest proportional increases of UK nations and regions since 2006 - 13%.\nWHERE YOU LIVE CAN BE A FACTOR\nFewer pupils from poorer parts of Wales get to university.\nEntry rates are broken down across the UK into constituencies and analysis shows they are lower in more disadvantaged areas.\nIn Wales, the entry rate range is from just under 18% of 18-year-olds in Aberavon, to just over 48% in Cardiff North.\nFor those in the most disadvantaged districts in Wales the average rate is 16.6%, almost the same as the year before.\nBut compared with entry rates five years ago, 18-year-olds from disadvantaged areas in Wales were 23% more likely to be accepted for entry in 2015 - in England they were 30% more likely.\nMeanwhile, students living in what are classed as the most advantaged areas of Wales are five-and-a-half times more likely to go to a university with higher entry requirements than those from the most disadvantaged parts.\nLeading academic Prof Sir Deian Hopkin said the numbers from poorer backgrounds getting to university were still disappointing despite efforts.\n\"One of the great challenges in higher education is to attract students from less-affluent backgrounds because. very often, they come from an education system which doesn't encourage them to come to university in the first place,\" he said.\n\"Now a lot has been done over the years, there has been a big improvement, but the proportion has not grown at the same rate as the total increase in students in higher education. Therefore the challenge remains.\"\nProf Hopkin added: \"The disappointment in England is that the grant which supported many students has been abolished.\n\"In Wales, at least that has been maintained for now, but we need to see far more effort being put into encouraging, supporting and, indeed, mentoring students from backgrounds where these things are not natural.\"\nWHERE DO STUDENTS AT WELSH UNIVERSITIES COME FROM?\nAltogether, 77,750 students have already applied to Welsh universities - 18,450 from within Wales.\nThe chart shows where the others come from - more than half of them from England.\nUNCONDITIONAL OFFERS ON THE RISE\nThere has been a rise in students receiving unconditional offers from universities - which will have relieved the exam pressure a little for some. Across the UK, offers were made to 23,400 students in 2015,  compared to only 3,000 two years before.\nThis is around 2.5% of applications and involves 36 institutions, but there is no breakdown of how many are from Wales.\nCardiff and Swansea universities only made unconditional offers to students who are pre-qualified. This amounted to 1,200 for Cardiff this year.\nAberystwyth University said it made offers based on performance in its own scholarship exam, while Bangor University said it made unconditional offers to some of the most promising students, but they were looking \"at the whole package\" before deciding where to go.\nCLEARING: NO LONGER A LAST RESORT\nAround 4,100 students from Wales were looking for places on results day through the clearing system, which is a lower number than the last five years.\nA total of 300 students from Wales were given places on the first day, according to Ucas.\nClearing has become more of an accepted way in, no longer something to be embarrassed about for not getting the right grades.\nUcas says clearing has \"transformed into a respected and important route\" into higher education.\nAll Welsh universities are promoting their clearing services heavily, promoting many courses across the board.\nCardiff University had around 400 places available through clearing.\nBangor University said it was \"no longer seen or used as an opportunity of last resort\" and said it was seeing more students waiting to get their results before applying.\nDavid Moyle, Aberystwyth University's schools and colleges liaison manager, said there was no longer a stigma attached to clearing.\nThe university took 1,000 calls last year and was offering \"a limited number of places\" across 315 courses, with demand expected to be high in science and computing.\nThe aim is to ensure students \"get the best advice to make an informed decision\", said Mr Moyle.\nBack in 2013, Ben Grantham's A-level results were better than he expected and he was on the phone within an hour to clearing to get a place studying media and communication.\n\"With a process such as clearing it's important to act fast,\" said Ben, who recently graduated with first class honours.\n\"Hundreds of students will be in a position where they wish to apply for a course immediately following their results, and places are often limited and can fill up fast.\"\nJoanna Harris, of Careers Wales, said clearing could sometimes be a blessing in disguise to give students a chance to reflect and warned against making rushed decisions.\n\"Take a breath, do your research, look at the Ucas website for what's available or even ring the university you wanted to go to to see if they might still accept you first.,\" she said.\n\"There is often more than one university in towns and cities - don't make a rash decision, it's important, with the amount of money it will cost you, that you make the choice of course that's right for you.\"\nCLEARING DETAILS\nOTHER ROUTES\nOnly two thirds of 18-year-olds who left school last year went on to university, according to research by Careers Wales.\nWHAT IF I DON'T GET THE RIGHT GRADES?\nKerry Ann Wallace, 20, from Newbridge, Caerphilly, was upset after failing to get the right grades to study psychology last year but was in touch with a careers adviser.\nIt led her to a youth work apprenticeship at Torfaen council and she has ambitions to be a family support worker.\n\"I haven't looked back and it's great to be earning money while I learn,\" she said.\n\"If you're disappointed this week please go and talk to someone as I did, look online for things and don't be upset - find something you love.\"\nCareer adviser Joanna Harris, of Careers Wales, said it was important to take stock and look at options - but volunteering, an internship or part-time work can be useful additions to CVs ahead of the next step.\nSome will retake exams but there are also useful websites, such as notgoingtouni, which can point students on the career path, including apprenticeships.\n\"There's a choice,\" said Ms Harris. \"Just because you didn't get into Cardiff University, say, there might be a course somewhere else, there are foundation degrees and feeder degrees.\n\"If you're struggling, book an appointment with us or call us.\"",

    "text": "Three years after Russia annexed Crimea, a move bitterly contested by Ukraine's government, the region remains in a state of flux. It's difficult to get into, and for many people, it's difficult to know where it's going.\nAt Kiev International Airport, I hand my passport to a border guard.\n\"Purpose of visit?\" he asks.\n\"Journalism. I'm with the BBC.\"\nHe pauses. He studies my passport. He seems to be checking a list. He goes to pick up a telephone and asks a question. He does not realise I can hear.\n\"You remember that pro-Russian journalist from the BBC? Was his surname Rosenberg?\"\nAnother pause.\n\"It wasn't? OK, thanks.\" He hangs up. He stamps my passport and returns it.\n\"Welcome to Ukraine!\" he smiles.\nThose pauses at passport control are an indication of the current tension between Moscow and Kiev - a relationship clouded by enmity and suspicion.\nOur BBC team is only passing through Kiev. Our final destination is Crimea, the Ukrainian peninsula annexed by Russia three years ago.\nFor journalists based in Russia, there are faster ways of reaching the Crimean peninsula. Board a plane in Moscow and two hours later you can be in the Crimean capital Simferopol. Ukraine, however, warns foreign nationals that anyone entering \"temporarily occupied Crimea\" without Kiev's permission and without crossing an official Ukrainian border may be banned from future entry to Ukraine.\nWe're taking the longer route.\nDirect flights from Russia to Ukraine stopped in October 2015. We flew from Moscow to the Belarusian capital Minsk, then on to Kiev. Ahead of us is an eight-hour road trip to Crimea.\nFirst, we visit the Ukrainian Migration Service in Kiev to obtain the \"dozvil\" - a document issued by the Ukrainian authorities permitting travel to Crimea. Three hours later, permission slips in hand, our long car journey south begins.\nRussia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 was a watershed moment. It pushed Moscow and the West to the brink of a new cold war. Three years on we are travelling to Crimea to gauge the mood.\nIt is dark by the time we reach the final Ukrainian checkpoint before the peninsula. Ukraine does not call the Kalanchak crossing a border - officially, it is a \"control point for entry and exit\". We show our passports and dozvils. Minutes later we are waved through.\nThe no-man's land between the Ukrainian and Russian checkpoints is tiny - no more than 50m long. We stop here to change cars - our Kiev driver will turn back.  A driver from Simferopol has come to meet us.\nOn the Russian side this is called the Armyansk crossing. As far as the Russians are concerned, it is an official state border. We show passports and visas and fill out immigration cards. Our documents are in order, but we are asked to wait. The appearance here of British journalists has raised official eyebrows.\nA young man in civilian clothes approaches me. \"Come with me, please,\" he says, \"I'd like to have a chat.\"\nWe enter a small room and sit down at a table. He checks my phone to make sure I am not recording our conversation.\nThen come the questions. Lots of them.\n\"What mission have your editors set you? What will you be filming? How will you be saving your material, on computers or hard drives? What SIM card will you be using in Crimea? As the correspondent, will you be making notes each night about what you have filmed? Can you show me some of the photos on your phone? Where will you be staying? Why didn't you fly direct from Moscow?\"\nMy interrogator notes down my answers on a piece of paper. His questions are not limited to Crimea.\n\"What street do you live on in Moscow? What is the nearest Metro station to your home? What does your wife do for a living? You've been in Russia a long time. Have you ever considered applying for a Russian passport?\"\n\"My British one suits me just fine,\" I reply.\n\"What do you think of English cuisine?\" he asks, adding, \"I like Jamie Oliver. Although I consider he uses too much oil.\"\nThe questioning lasts an hour. Then the official escorts me back to the van. I ask for his name.\n\"I have no name,\" he replies, \"only a rank.\"\nThe inquisitive young man with \"no name, only a rank\" invites my colleagues for similar conversations.\nThree hours pass. Interrogations over, we are still not free to go. We spend the night in the van waiting for Russian customs officers to process our papers and allow our TV equipment through. Ten hours after arriving at the Armyansk crossing, we finally clear the checkpoint.\nSimferopol is the administrative centre of Crimea. The name of our hotel is the \"Ukraine\". But three years after annexation, the town feels Russian. Most of the cars have switched to Russian number plates, brand new buses manufactured near Moscow have taken to the roads. And, peering down from billboards is the Russian president with some of his choicest Crimea quotations - just to remind everyone who is in charge.\n\"Crimea was famous for being the spa of the Soviet Union,\" declares Vladimir Putin in one poster. \"We will, of course, develop this.\"\n\"All Russian army social programmes will be extended to Sevastopol and the Black Sea Fleet,\" he promises in another.\nNear our hotel, the wall of a building is covered with a giant painting of President Putin dressed as a sailor and the words: \"Crimea belongs to all of us\".\nAs far as retired teacher Olga Koziko is concerned, the more Putin in Crimea, the better.\n\"Crimea is a place where people support Putin,\" Olga assures me. \"We just adore him. He's our hero. I even have a T-shirt with Putin and the words: 'In Putin We Trust', like 'In God We Trust.' Thanks to Putin, Russian soldiers came to protect us.\"\nOn 22 February 2014, Ukraine's pro-Moscow president Viktor Yanukovych fled the country after what he - and his Russian allies - called an \"illegal coup\" in Kiev. On 27 February masked men in unmarked uniforms appeared in Simferopol. Armed with Russian weapons, they seized government buildings, the parliament, the airport and blocked Ukrainian army bases. This mysterious military force picked up a variety of nicknames, including The Little Green Men and The Polite People.\nToday Moscow admits the soldiers were from Russia's secretive Special Operations Forces (the SSO). President Putin subsequently signed a decree making 27 February an annual celebration in Russia - \"Special Operations Forces Day\".\nFollowing a hastily organised referendum, it was announced that more than 95% of people who had taken part had voted for Crimea's \"reunification\" with Russia. The referendum was not recognised by the international community. To the outside world, Russia had grabbed a piece of Ukraine.\nA statue honouring The Little Green Men has been erected near the Crimean parliament building. It depicts a young girl handing flowers to a man with a gun. The inscription reads: \"To The Polite People from the grateful people of Crimea.\"\nThis is how Moscow wants to be seen here: as a force for good, protecting the people of Crimea from violent Ukrainian nationalists. In 2014 Russia's state-controlled media characterised the new Ukrainian government as \"fascists\", \"neo-Nazis\" and an \"illegitimate junta''. Olga uses similar language as she recalls the past.\n\"Without Russia, a lot of people would have been killed here,\" maintains Olga. \"Ukrainian Nazis said Crimea would either be part of Ukraine or empty. People would have been oppressed. Perhaps even put in concentration camps.\"\nThere is absolutely no evidence to substantiate Olga's claims.\nMany of those in Crimea who welcome Moscow's rule see the bloody conflict in eastern Ukraine as confirmation that Russia is a safer home. They discount evidence that unrest in the Donbass was incited and bankrolled by Moscow.\nOut on the street I get chatting to a pensioner called Nadezhda. Until recently her sister had been living in Luhansk, one of the self-proclaimed separatist republics in eastern Ukraine.\n\"Life in Luhansk is terrible,\" Nadezhda says. \"So I moved my sister to Crimea. I will do everything to make sure that kind of violence doesn't break out here.\"\nThere is another reason why Nadezhda, an ethnic Ukrainian, trusts Moscow more than Kiev - it is out of nostalgia for Soviet times, when she regarded Moscow as her capital. Nadezhda describes Crimea joining Russia as \"a return to the Soviet Union.  Our generation was, is and will always be in the USSR. We will die in the Soviet Union.\"\nNostalgia and fear are powerful feelings. But they are not enough to sustain pro-Russia sentiment in Crimea at the level of 2014.\nSevering ties to Ukraine has brought problems. With economic links to Ukraine cut, the only way of keeping the peninsula supplied is by sea or air. That means higher prices. Moscow insists that will change once it has completed a road and rail bridge linking Crimea to the Russian mainland. The bridge is a multibillion-dollar statement that Moscow is here to stay.\nAs well as higher prices, there is Russian red tape.\nI visit a document registration centre in Simferopol. More than two hundred people are queueing outside. They have come to exchange Ukrainian documents, like deeds for apartments, for Russian ones. Some people, like Alyona, have been queuing here all night.\n\"Life hasn't got better or worse,\" Alyona tells me, \"We're still standing in lines, like we always used to. Maybe some people had big expectations three years ago. But I don't believe in miracles.\"\nI ask Alyona if she could imagine Russia handing Crimea back to Ukraine.\n\"Nothing would surprise me any more,\" she laughs. \"I wouldn't be surprised if we suddenly ended up as part of Turkey. To be honest, I don't care if we're with China! The most important thing is that there is no war.\n\"I've learnt that your life can be turned upside down in a day. And there is nothing you can do about it. We're like pawns on a chessboard. They're playing with us. Today our place is in Russia. And tomorrow? Who knows. Maybe that's for the best: if we knew, we might have a heart attack.\"\nAcross town, I meet Nadia. She is complaining to me about potholes.\n\"Where I live there are potholes everywhere,\" Nadia says. \"People have been hurting their legs. I've written to the authorities asking them to do something. They haven't lifted a finger.\"\nNadia's disappointment extends further than pavements and roads.\n\"Many people here were happy, but there is disillusionment now,\" she tells me, \"because there is no investment and salaries and pensions are small. My pension is 8000 roubles ($140; \u00c2\u00a3112) a month. Just about enough to cover utility bills and the medicines I need.\"\nI am talking to Nadia beside the statue of Ukraine's most famous 19th Century poet, Taras Shevchenko. It is Shevchenko Day and a group of twenty people have come here with flowers to mark the poet's birthday. Russian police have come, too - with cameras. They are filming everyone, including us. In Russian Crimea, public expressions of Ukrainian pride attract special attention.\nNadia is an ethnic Russian, but she is wearing a small Ukrainian flag.\n\"In my soul, Crimea is still part of Ukraine,\" Nadia tells me. \"I'm here because this statue is the last symbol of Ukraine left in Crimea.\"\nA woman called Lidiya overhears our conversation. She is furious.\n\"It was the Russian Empress Catherine the Great who built up Crimea,\" says Lidiya sternly.\n\"Well, if you're going to bring up history, we could go right back to the days of the Crimean khans,\" retorts Nadia.\nLidiya switches to modern history.\n\"Three years ago America was planning to station soldiers in three schools in Sevastopol,\" she claims. \"Nato troops wanted to be in Sevastopol. Crimea would have been wiped from the face of the earth.\"\n\"How do you know that?\" I ask.\n\"I read it in the internet,\" she replies.\n\"Does that make it true?\"\nLidiya changes tack.\n\"If people think they live badly in Crimea today, let them go and live in the Donbass in eastern Ukraine. They will be crying to come back here.\"\nWe drive to the town of Bakhchysarai in central Crimea to meet Umer Ibragimov. Umer, a Crimean Tatar, is desperate for information about his son Ervin. In May 2016 Ervin was abducted late at night. CCTV cameras caught the moment he was seized by men in uniform and bundled into a vehicle.\n\"I've written to everyone asking for help,\" Umer tells me, \"from the bottom levels right up to the president. But there has been no information about my son.\"\nErvin Ibragimov was a member of the executive board of the World Congress of Crimean Tatars. Since annexation, the Crimean Tatar community has come under pressure. Its elected representative body, the Mejlis, which had opposed the 2014 referendum on joining Russia, has been ruled an \"extremist organisation\" and banned.\nHuman rights group Amnesty International accuses the Russian authorities of \"systematic persecution\" of Crimean Tatars. This month the European Union's foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini concluded that \"the rights of the Crimean Tatars have been gravely violated\". Moscow denies the accusations.\nOver piping hot tea, Umer tells me the story of his family. In World War Two, his father had fought in the Red Army.\n\"He was wounded and came home,\" Umer says. \"Ten days later, all Crimean Tatars were deported from their homeland.\"\nIt was Josef Stalin who had ordered the deportation - an act of collective punishment and paranoia. The Soviet dictator suspected Crimean Tatars of collaborating with the Nazis. More than 230,000 people were forced on to cattle trains and transported to Central Asia.\n\"My mother and father told me later they'd be given just 15 minutes to gather their belongings,\" recalls Umer.\nUmer grew up in Soviet Uzbekistan. Conscripted into the Soviet army in the late 1970s, he spent a year fulfilling his \"internationalist duty\" fighting in Afghanistan.\nUmer looks at a photograph of his missing son.\n\"There is no justice,\" he says.\nAnd yet this Crimean spring feels calmer than three years ago. While Russia and the West argue over sanctions, sovereignty and borders, it seems that most people here are just trying to get on with their lives, trying to adapt.\n\"Everything calmed down,\" artist Svitlana Gavrilenko says. \"Everyone who used to be 'pro' something - either pro-Russia or pro-Ukraine - everybody calmed down.\"\nThree years ago Svitlana had opposed annexation. Today her perspective has changed.\n\"A lot of small and medium-sized businesses fell apart after Russia came because they were all connected to Ukraine.  Now they have reconnected to Russia and China. If we become a part of Ukraine again, we will need to solve all this stuff again. Everyone's life is going to be screwed up again.\"\nIn the Black Sea resort of Yalta I find the promenade packed with people enjoying a seaside stroll in the sunshine. The sound of the waves crashing on the shore mixes with jazz chords from street musicians.  From the conversations, there is an overriding sense of a population desperate for peace.\n\"Many people in Crimea still love Ukraine,\" Rodion says. \"Russia and Ukraine are too similar, their peoples too inter-connected to feel bad about each other.\"\nRodion believes \"it's not completely impossible\" that Crimea would one day return to Ukrainian rule.\n\"Nobody ever imagined it would become a part of Russia,\" he says, though he resents Western leaders who demand the peninsula's return. \"Crimea is not just a thing to be given to one country or another. It's a place. It's the people who live here. It's history. It's many things that cannot be bought or inter-changed.\"\nSvitlana Gavrilenko believes that the changes that took place here three years ago are irreversible.\n\"I don't think Russia in its modern state, with Putin at the top, could ever give Crimea back,\" she tells me. \"They made so much effort to connect it. They suffered through all these sanctions just to have Crimea. Why would they give it back?\"",

    "text": "The IPCC - weren't they the ones who said the Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035? How can we trust what they say this time?\nThe weight given to the reports of the IPCC is a measure of the global scale of scientific involvement with the panel.\nDivided into three working groups that look at the physical science, the impacts and options to limit climate change, the panel involves thousands of scientists around the world.\nThe first report, to be presented in Stockholm, has 209 lead authors and 50 review editors from 39 countries.\nThe 30-page Summary for Policymakers that will be published after review by government officials in the Swedish capital is based on around 9,000 peer-reviewed scientific papers and 50,000 comments from the expert reviewers.\nBut among these icebergs of data, things can and do go awry.\nIn the last report, published in 2007, there were a handful of well publicised errors, including the claim that Himalayan glaciers would disappear by 2035. The wrong percentage was also given for the amount of land in the Netherlands under sea level.\nThe IPCC admitted it had got it wrong and explained that, in a report running to 3,000 pages, there were bound to be some mistakes. The Himalayan claim came from the inclusion of an interview that had been published in the magazine New Scientist.\nIn its own words, the IPCC is there \"to provide the world with a clear scientific view on the current state of knowledge in climate change and its potential environmental and socio-economic impacts\".\nThe offspring of two UN bodies, the World Meteorological Organization and the United Nations Environment Programme, it has issued four heavyweight assessment reports to date on the state of the climate.\nThese are commissioned by the governments of 195 countries, essentially the entire world. These reports are critical in informing the climate policies adopted by these governments.\nThe IPCC itself is a small organisation, run from Geneva with a full time staff of 12. All the scientists who are involved with it do so on a voluntary basis.\nIn 2009, a review of the way the IPCC assesses information suggested the panel should be very clear in future about the sources of the information it uses.\nThe panel was also scarred by association with the \"Climategate\" rumpus. Leaked emails between scientists working for the IPCC were stolen and published in 2009.\nThey purported to show some collusion between researchers to make climate data fit the theory of human-induced global warming more clearly. However at least three investigations found no evidence to support this conclusion.\nBut the overall effect of these events on the panel has been to make them more cautious.\nAlthough this new report is likely to stress a greater certainty among scientists that human activities are causing climate warming, in terms of the scale, level and impacts, the word \"uncertainty\" features heavily.\n\"What we are seeing now is that this working group is getting more careful than they already were,\" said Prof Arthur Petersen, chief scientist at the Netherlands Environmental Assessment Agency.\n\"Overall, the message is, in that sense, more conservative I expect, for this IPCC report compared to previous ones.\"\nHasn't global warming stopped since 1998?\nThe 2007 IPCC report made no mention of any slowdown or standstill in temperature rises in recent decades. They pointed out that the linear warming trend over the previous 50 years was 0.13C per decade, which was twice that for the past 100 years.\nThey forecast that, if emissions of carbon dioxide continued on their existing path, over the next century the climate would respond by warming between 2C and 4.5C, with a most likely rise of 3C.\nBut since 2007, climate sceptics have loudly argued that global average temperatures haven't actually gone above the level recorded in 1998.\nThe issue is now being taken more seriously by the IPCC and other respected science organisations.\nMy colleague David Shukman summarised some of the explanations now being offered as to why the temperatures have not risen more quickly in line with the modelling.\nMost scientists believe that the warming has continued over the past 15 years, but more of the heat has gone into the oceans. They are unsure about the mechanisms driving this change in behaviour.\nThe most recent peer reviewed article suggested that a periodic, natural cooling of the Pacific Ocean was counteracting the impact of carbon dioxide.\n\"1998 was a particular hot year due to a record-breaking El Ni\u00f1o event, while recently we have had mostly the opposite - cool conditions in the tropical Pacific,\" Prof Stefan Rahmstorf, from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research in Germany, told BBC News.\n\"That warming has not stopped can be seen from the ongoing heat accumulation in the global oceans.\"\nClimate sceptics, however, argue that the pause is evidence that climate models used by the IPCC are too sensitive and exaggerate the effects of carbon dioxide.\n\"In the last year, we have seen several studies showing that climate sensitivity is actually much less than we thought for the last 30 years,\" said Marcel Crok, a Dutch author who is sceptical of the IPCC process.\n\"These studies show that our real climate has a sensitivity of between 1.5C and 2.0C. But the models are much more sensitive, and warm up three degrees.\"\nAm I going to get flooded?\nThe 2007 IPCC report was heavily criticised for its estimations on sea level rise.\nThe panel suggested that a warming planet would see waters around the world rise by between 18cm and 59cm by the end of this century. Heat causes the seas to expand but also increases the rate of melting of glaciers and ice sheets.\nThe IPCC doesn't commission any new science, but reviews and condenses existing peer reviewed material.\nEach Summary for Policymakers is a short distillation of an underlying report that can stretch to several hundred pages. The final draft of the short summary is presented to representatives of the 195 governments who commission the report.\nIn a hectic week before publication, every single line is gone through by the scientists and civil servants. The lead authors are in the room and can veto a change if it isn't supported in the underlying report.\nThe IPCC figure didn't include any estimates for the extra water coming from the Greenland or Antarctic ice sheets as they said they didn't have enough accurate information.\nOther researchers were critical of this approach and have published studies that suggested a far higher sea level rise.\nBut in recent months, a study funded by the European Union and involving scientists across the world, came up with what they believe is the most accurate estimate yet - and it increases the level of sea rise by just 10cm from the IPCC report.\n\"What we are talking about is a reduction in uncertainty - we find we haven't changed the number enormously compared to AR4 (IPCC 2007 report),\" said Prof David Vaughan, from the British Antarctic Survey (Bas), while speaking at the launch of the report.\n\"We've added maybe another 10cm but the level of certainty we have around that is actually higher than it was in the AR4.\"\nLeaked details from the forthcoming report indicate that the worst sea level rise scenarios for the year 2100, under the highest emissions of carbon dioxide, could reach 97cm.\nSome scientists, including Prof Rahmstorf, have been unhappy with the models used by the IPCC to calculate the rise. Using what's termed a semi-empirical model, the projections for sea level can reach 2m. At that point, an extra 187 million people across the world would be flooded.\nBut the IPCC is likely to say that there is no consensus about the semi-empirical approach and will stick with the lower figure of just under 1m.\nSo will all this mean more flooding?\n\"Yes, but not everywhere,\" said Prof Piers Forster from the University of Leeds. \"Generally, the wet regions will get wetter and the dry ones drier.\"\nThe report is also likely to assess the intensity of storms, and there might be some better news in that there is likely to be a downwards revision.\nAnd what about the Polar bears?\nThe state of the North and South Poles has been of growing concern to science as the effects of global warming are said to be more intense in these regions.\nThe IPCC has evolved a complicated way of communicating scientific certainty and confidence in a finding:\nvery unlikely - 0-10%\nunlikely - 10-33%\nlikely as not - 33-66%\nlikely - 66-100%\nvery likely - 90-100%\nExtremely likely - 95-100%\nVirtually certain - 99-100%\nConfidence is also expressed as very low, low, medium, high and very high.\nEvidence can can be limited, medium or robust.\nAnd levels of agreement can be low, medium or high\nIn 2007, the IPCC said that temperatures in the Arctic increased at almost twice the global average rate in the past 100 years. They pointed out that the region can be highly variable, with a warm period observed between 1925 and 1945.\nIn the drafts of the latest report, the scientists say there is stronger evidence that ice sheets and glaciers are losing mass and sea ice cover is decreasing in the Arctic.\nIn relation to Greenland, which by itself has the capacity to raise global sea levels by six metres, the panel says they are 90% certain that the average rate of ice loss between 1992 and 2001 has increased six-fold in the period 2002 to 2011.\nWhile the Arctic mean sea ice extent has declined by around 4% per decade since 1979, the Antarctic has increased up to 1.8% per decade over the same time period.\nAs for the future, the suggestions are quite dramatic. Under the worst carbon emissions scenarios, an Arctic free of sea ice in the summer by the middle of this century is likely.\nSome recent newspaper reports have suggested that sea ice in the Arctic has recovered in 2013, but scientists are virtually certain about the trend.\n\"The sea ice cover on the Arctic ocean is in a downward spiral,\" said Prof Rahmstorf. \"And much faster than IPCC predicted.\"\nAnd Prof Shang-Ping Xie from the University of California in San Diego told BBC News that the outlook for polar bears and other species isn't good.\n\"There will be pockets of sea ice in some marginal seas. Hopefully, polar bears will be able to survive summer on these pockets of remaining sea ice,\" he said.\nDoes the IPCC have a future?\nThere have been growing calls for reform of the IPCC process from critics and friends alike.\nMany believe that these big, blockbuster reports, published once every six years, are not the way forward in the modern era.\n\"The close government scrutiny and infrequent publication certainly fillip the climate change agenda,\" said Prof Forster.\n\"But, given the pace of both science and news, perhaps it is time the IPCC moved with the Twitter generation.\"\nMany sceptical voices are also calling for changes.\nMarcel Crok says the whole process of the IPCC is bad for the scientific principle of open argument.\n\"It is not designed to answer questions because the whole IPCC process, the whole consensus-building process, is choking the openness of the scientific debate,\" he explained.\nHowever, some argue the IPCC plays an important role as a source of information for developing countries.\nAnd again others think the organisation will survive for far more unprincipled reasons. \"It is a UN body,\" said Prof Petersen. \"It may perpetuate until eternity.\"\nFollow Matt on Twitter.",

    "text": "A US-led coalition of of Western and Middle Eastern countries began air strikes against the group in Iraq in August 2014 and in Syria a month later.\nThe UK began striking IS targets in Iraq in September 2014 and extended its involvement to Syria in December 2015.\nRussia began carrying out its own air strikes in Syria in September 2015 after a request from Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has clung on to power despite more than four years of civil war.\nHere we look at where the key countries involved in the conflict stand.\nThe US air force has carried out the majority of air strikes against IS targets since forming a coalition of Western and regional powers in August 2014.\nPresident Barack Obama is extremely reluctant to send ground troops to fight IS after protracted and unpopular wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, but the US does have about 3,500 troops in Iraq to train the country's armed forces.\nThe US has also provided weapons and training to \"moderate\" Syrian rebel groups, and unconfirmed reports suggest US special forces have been fighting alongside anti-IS forces in both Iraq and Syria.\nIn October US Defence Secretary Ashton Carter signalled a possible shift in the US campaign against IS, telling reporters that US forces were prepared to engage in \"direct action on the ground\".\nMr Carter did not go into detail about the circumstances under which the US might carry out ground operations against IS, but said: \"Once we locate them, no target is beyond our reach.\"\nRegional Sunni power Saudi Arabia is part of US-led military action against IS targets in Syria.\nRiyadh also agreed to a US request to provide a base to train moderate Syrian rebel forces.\nThe kingdom has been a key supporter of the rebels, including hardline Islamist groups, but it has rejected an Iranian accusation that it has directly supported IS.\nHowever, wealthy Saudis have sent donations to the group and some 2,500 Saudi men have travelled to Syria to fight.\nThe Saudi authorities are concerned that IS will inspire Saudi jihadists to challenge the monarchy's legitimacy and seek to overthrow it.\nIn July 2014, Riyadh deployed 30,000 troops to beef up security along its border with Iraq, and the following month hosted Iran's deputy foreign minister as the two regional rivals agreed to co-operate.\nJordan, a staunch US ally, said it had joined the US and several Gulf Arab states in carrying out air strikes on IS militants in Syria in September 2014 to \"ensure the stability and security\" of its borders.\nA government spokesman said it took action in order to \"pre-empt danger before it arrived in our country\", and that he believed the Jordanian public would understand the need to forestall the jihadist group before it became active in Jordan.\nIS has threatened to \"break down\" Jordan's borders and the group enjoys the support of a growing number of people in the kingdom, some of whom staged demonstrations in the southern town of Maan in June 2014. More than 2,000 Jordanian citizens are believed to have travelled to Syria to fight in the past three years.\nBefore launching the air strikes on IS, the Jordanian military had doubled its military presence along the border with Iraq.\nThe killing of Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh, captured by IS in December 2014, appears to have strengthened the government's resolve to take on the militants, with King Abdullah II saying his death would not be in vain and promising a \"severe response\".\nRegional Shia power Iran has seen IS - which regards Shia Muslims as heretics who should be killed - advance to within 25 miles (40km) of its border.\nAlthough Iran stands on the opposite side of much of the international community over Syria, it has called for co-operation against IS. It has reached out to its rival Saudi Arabia - the leading Sunni power - and turned a blind eye to US actions in Iraq, which it has historically opposed.\nOfficially Iran denies it has deployed any combat troops in Syria, but in June 2015, the official Irna news agency said at least 400 Iranian and Iran-based Afghan \"volunteers\" had been killed in the past four years.\nIn Iraq, the Iranians have played a key role in countering IS. Revolutionary Guards have advised Iraqi security forces, Iranian pilots have carried out air strikes, and Iranian-backed Shia militia have been mobilised.\nIran's growing role in Syria's war\nThe former Shia-dominated government of Nouri Maliki marginalised Iraq's Sunni community, creating conditions which helped the extremist Sunni IS come to prominence.\nWhen IS overran the northern city of Mosul in June 2014 before moving southwards, Mr Maliki requested US air strikes. However, US President Barack Obama said further military assistance was dependent on an inclusive government being formed.\nHe nevertheless launched air strikes in August 2014 when thousands of members of the Yazidi religious minority became trapped on Mount Sinjar.\nIn September 2014, Mr Maliki stepped aside and a new Iraqi government was named. The next phase of US assistance will reportedly involve an intensified effort to train, advise and equip the Iraqi military, Kurdish Peshmerga fighters and Sunni tribesmen willing to turn against IS.\nIt is not clear how new Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi will deal with the Shia militiamen who have stopped IS reaching Baghdad. Some have been accused of operating outside of the state's control and carrying out reprisal attacks against Sunnis.\nSince the start of the uprising against his rule in March 2011, President Bashar al-Assad has repeatedly warned of the threat of Islamist extremists to Syria and the wider region.\nWestern powers initially dismissed Mr Assad's portrayal of his opponents as \"terrorists\", but became increasingly concerned by the rise of IS and al-Qaeda's affiliate, al-Nusra Front.\nAlthough they now acknowledge that IS cannot be beaten without attacking its strongholds in Syria, Western powers still want Mr Assad out of power and are reluctant to co-operate with him.\nThe Syrian foreign ministry said it was given advance warning of the US-led air strikes on IS targets on its territory in September 2014, stating it supported international efforts at \"combating terrorism\".\nRussia is not part of the US-led coalition but started carrying out air strikes in Syria in September 2015. It has also launched missiles from warships in the Caspian Sea.\nPresident Vladimir Putin says his country is targeting IS strongholds and other militant fighters. However, the US fears Russia is actually targeting opponents of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who is a Russian ally.\nRussia now believes that a bomb brought down the Russian airliner over Egypt last month, killing more than 200 people, mostly Russian holidaymakers. Sinai Province, an IS-linked Egyptian group, said it had downed the jet.\nRussia 'pounding IS' in Syria\nThe UAE was reported to have offered its air force to attack IS positions in Iraq before it participated in the military action in Syria in September 2014.\nIt is vehemently opposed to Islamist groups in the region and is believed to have launched air strikes on Islamist-allied militia in Libya from bases in Egypt in August 2014.\nHowever, US officials have told the BBC that the UAE suspended its involvement in the strikes after the Jordanian pilot was captured.\nQatar was another Gulf state to participate in or support the US-led military action against IS in Syria. The emirate is the location of Al Udeid Air Base, a highly-classified US facility from which all attack and surveillance missions in the region are co-ordinated by US Central Command (CentCom).\nThe Qatari government has been forced to repeatedly deny accusations from Iraq's Shia leaders that it provided financial support to IS. However, wealthy individuals in the emirate are believed to have made donations and the government has given money and weapons to hardline Islamist groups in Syria.\nDoha is also believed to have links to the al-Nusra Front, an al-Qaeda affiliate.\nBahrain has also participated in or supported the US-led military action against IS in Syria.\nThe kingdom hosts the headquarters of the US Navy's Fifth Fleet, which is responsible for naval forces in the Gulf, Red Sea, Arabian Sea and parts of the Indian Ocean.\nTurkey is eager to defeat IS, which has advanced into territory along its borders with Syria and Iraq.\nTurkey believes that the deadly bombings in the border town of Suruc, in July 2015, which killed 32 youth activists, and in the capital Ankara in October, which killed nearly 100, were carried out by IS.\nTurkish jets have carried out attacks on IS positions in Syria, and the Nato member is allowing US jets to use its southern Incirlik air base.\nTurkey v Islamic State v the Kurds\nLebanon has become deeply divided by the conflict in Syria, and has had to deal with an overspill of violence and a huge influx of refugees.\nIn August 2014, Syria-based IS fighters raided the border town of Arsal, killing and kidnapping dozens of Lebanese security personnel.\nJihadist militants have also carried out a series of deadly bombings in Beirut and elsewhere. They have mostly targeted Iranian facilities and Hezbollah, the Lebanese Shia Islamist group whose fighters have played a key role in helping turn the tide in President Assad's favour.\nLebanese Prime Minister Tammam Salam has warned that the spread of IS poses \"a big test that our destiny depends on\". His country's many religious and political factions have been urged to put aside their differences to ensure the group does not establish a foothold.\nEgypt, Kuwait, and Oman joined Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Qatar, Bahrain, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon in signing a communique at a meeting in Jeddah that declared their \"shared commitment to stand united against the threat posed by all terrorism\". They pledged to provide military support and humanitarian aid, and to halt the flow of funds and foreign fighters to IS.\nFrance was part of the US-led coalition targeting IS in Iraq from September 2014. In September 2015 it carried out its first raids on targets in Syria.\nPresident Francois Hollande vowed to intensify strikes against IS after the group said it was behind the deadly attacks in Paris of 13 November 2015.\nThe UK parliament voted in December 2015 to extend its bombing campaign against IS in Iraq to targets in Syria. The motion to strike targets in Syria was put forward by the Conservative government and opposed by the Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn.\nMr Corbyn urged Labour MPs to vote against the strikes but allowed them a free vote, and 67 MPs voted in favour. UK strikes began the night of the vote, with RAF Tornados bombing an IS-controlled Omar oil fields in eastern Syria.\nThe UK parliament had in 2013 voted against strikes in Syria. It approved British air strikes against IS targets in Iraq in September 2014.\nBelgium, Denmark and the Netherlands are part of the US-led coalition carrying out strikes in Iraq.\nOn 4 December 2015, the German parliament backed plans for the country to join the fight against IS in Syria, three weeks after the Paris attacks in November 2015.\nGermany previously provided weapons to Kurdish fighters but ruled out air strikes.\nNew Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has confirmed he will withdraw Canadian fighter jets from the air strikes against IS in Iraq and Syria, fulfilling a campaign pledge.\nHe informed President Obama of his decision hours after winning Canada's general election in October 2015.\nAustralia is part of the international military coalition targeting IS strongholds in Syria and Iraq.\nIt launched its first air strikes inside Syria in September.",

    "text": "It is 22 miles (35km) north of Cardiff.\nThe colliery closed 25 years ago this week but it has not been the only local landmark to shut.\nMaerdy Workingmen's Hall was demolished; then there was the demise of the post office and the bookmakers' shop. Even the church closed.\nFour years ago, the village found itself fighting, unsuccessfully, to keep St Mary's open as the Church in Wales faced a \u00a3400,000 repair bill.\nA couple of takeaways lie empty on the high street and a cafe closed a few months ago.\nBut there is a butcher's shop, a pharmacy, doctors' surgery, a grocers, florist, beauty salon and a hairdressers. There is a bar and two social clubs.\nThere are plans to rebuild the Spar shop on a bigger site nearby. Importantly, the village charity shop helps raise money for projects around the area.\n\"A lot of the shops have shut down,\" says Susan Jones. \"I used to work for Rhian's cake and bread shop but that closed and I started work here.\"\nShe is behind the fryer at M&Ms fish and chip shop - one of two chippies in the village, the other at the bottom end of the village. It is the warmest place in Maerdy on a winter's day, with a biting wind outside.\nWhen the owners took over eight years ago, they extended through to open a cafe. Residents pop in for a coffee or to pick up pie and chips. I asked for curry sauce on my chips and there were three varieties. I had to try \"Irish curry sauce\" - sweet and spicy, if you want to know.\nSusan, 57, whose husband Gareth, 59, worked at the pit, recalls the closure but also remembers the strike just five years before that.\n\"My daughter was born in the miners' strike,\" she said, \"It was a difficult time, we struggled, we didn't have a lot of money.\n\"But the village all pulled together. We used to have Maerdy Hall just across the road there and food delivered from people everywhere.\n\"We had food parcels given to us. I remember having tins of tomatoes, tins of beans and corn beef, a Fray Bentos pie and perhaps five pounds of potatoes and that would be it.\"\nAfter the pit closed \"it was awful for a long time. All the men fought so hard to keep it open. And all the women were all behind them too.\"\nMrs Jones' husband had a few jobs before retraining as a wall tiler.\n\"I don't think it's the same since the pit shut. We need more factories or something up here.\"\nTHE MAERDY ECONOMY\nLooking at Maerdy, there are problems which are familiar to other villages and small towns up and down the country. But there is also a legacy of its mining past.\nThere is no railway station to serve just over half the population of 3,500 who are working age. The track which served the colliery was pulled up; the nearest station is five miles (8km) away in Aberdare, or down the valley, six miles (10km) away in Porth.\nCommunities First have eight areas in the Rhondda Cynon Taf county area working on projects to boost learning, skills and health, as well as running youth sessions.\nCoordinator for the Rhondda Fach area, Ros Davies, runs work and skills clubs.\n\"There's a Catch 22,\" she says. \"People need to travel for work but the pay needs to be enough for them to afford it. Car ownership is quite low here. The bus service is very good but it's expensive.\n\"I've been here since 2002 and it's quite a resilient community. Maybe that's due to the miners' strike, but people will join together and put things on to raise money.\"\nMAERDY FIGHTING BACK - THE LIBRARY CAMPAIGN\nWhat Maerdy is not short of is community spirit.\nThe most recent battle was to reopen the village library, closed due to budget cuts. Thanks to a charity - Friends of Ferndale - it reopened as a village hub and employs two community workers.\nAs well as children's activities, there is a Welsh class, craft morning and there are plans for adult learning classes. A mobile library will visit and it is hoped it will be a satellite for the Welsh government-funded Flying Start programme.\nThis provides free childcare with the aim of helping mothers back into work or training, which has already set up at the village secondary school.\nNatalie Wells, 40, who has a cake decorating business, was at school when Mardy Colliery closed and remembers \"tough times\".\nShe talks about the Maerdy spirit and how the community got behind the library campaign.\n\"We had a petition - thousands of signatures - tried all ways for funding, people volunteered just for it not to close but the funding was cut and it was closed,\" she said.\n\"We fought hard for this. The kids need it, there's not a lot around, the youth clubs were closing, we don't want them on the streets.\n\"This is lovely, they come from school, making crafts with friends and it teaches them more of the community spirit of what it was like when we were their age.\"\nMAERDY FIGHTING BACK - THE BOXING CLUB\nThe fighting spirit is there in abundance three evenings a week at Maerdy Boxing Club.\nBusinessman Brett Parry set up the club nearly three years ago with coach Mike Hughes.\nEven on a terrible night, with torrential rain pounding on the roof, eight youngsters have turned out for a full gym work out.\nThey put them through their paces and joke with them that they will be sent out on one of the gym's training runs up one of the village hills. Luckily, these are reserved for the summer months.\nAfter \"taking a punt\" on buying a dilapidated building, the community rallied around the pair as they looked to renovate it.\n\"Everyone came together, every tradesmen under the sun offering not only free labour but also materials,\" said Mr Parry.\n\"The offers have been endless. The help in the village alone has been superb.\n\"It goes to show you need one person to come up with an idea and be that leading figure and then there are a lot of people who want to help.\"\nThose using it are aged 10 to 60 and since 2013, the club has had four Welsh novice champions - aged from 10 to 16.\nThe children also have someone to look up to - coach Mr Hughes' 21-year-old son Alex \"Bad News\" Hughes is a super middleweight with high hopes that can only be good news for Maerdy.\nHe now has six fights unbeaten as a professional, training out of Gary Lockett's gym in Cardiff and with Frank Warren promoting him.\n\"Alex is on the right path and a big prospect,\" says Brett. \"It's great for the children to see him - he'll use the gym here a couple of times a week - but they can look up to someone and what you can achieve if you work hard.\"\nA school friend of Mr Parry is Keiron Montague. Both were eight-years-old when the colliery closed.\nHis father, Barrie, lost his job after 24 years in the pit but had qualified as an electrician and he was able to find work.\nKeiron Montague \"absolutely loved\" growing up in Maerdy.\n\"We had a fantastic environment and I really enjoyed school; there were lots of activities going on, fantastic local groups and that community spirit,\" he said.\nHe left to study for a degree in Cardiff but returned to live and worked running youth services in Merthyr Tydfil, across the heads of the valleys.\nHe became the councillor for Maerdy three years ago, and is now full-time with the authority as deputy leader of Rhondda Cynon Taf council.\n\"Most of the people I've spoken to who worked in the mines never found it the same afterwards - the camaraderie and the type of employment,\" he said.\n\"But a lot of people have moved on and done very well for themselves. But some have struggled and we have a history of poor health.\"\nMr Montague said a focus on skills and infrastructure was starting to improve things.\n\"There's been vast improvement in the education performance of our schools in the last 10 years,\" he said.\n\"We're getting these skills right. We've got a fantastic primary school at the hub of the community and a secondary school which is renowned across Wales for the quality of its teaching and learning.\n\"There are loads of success stories, people I went to school with are doctors and pharmacists and a friend of mine worked on the Cern particle accelerator.\"\nA ROAD TO REGENERATION?\nAround half of people work locally as tradesmen or for small businesses or in factories.\nBut the proportion commuting to jobs in places such as Cardiff or Treforest is less than half the average for Wales.\nIn 2007, \u00a398m Rhondda bypass opened and was seen as a major regeneration catalyst. Traffic no longer had to wind its way up narrow roads through the town of Porth and former mining villages.\nBut the new road stops just south of Tylorstown and motorists have to rejoin the old road as it takes an incline up the valley and the final miles to Maerdy.\nMr Montague said: \"We still need the last leg of that journey from Tylorstown. Things have improved in terms of the road infrastructure.\n\"People look at the way the public sector and the way the economy is and think it's going to be like that for ever - doom and gloom.\n\"There will be a time when it picks back up and it's about us being ready to take those opportunities.\"\nMOVING TO MAERDY?\nThe council is looking to use its powers to make private housing development more feasible in the valleys, to attract builders beyond the historic \"snow line\" at Pontypridd.\nMr Montague believes new homes in the village will not only bring construction jobs \"but people living there will put money back into the economy as well\".\nHe does not agree with one estate agent who told me Maerdy's image as deprived was not attractive to buyers.\nPrices for terraced homes typically range from \u00a350,000 to \u00a380,000.\nFirst-time buyers were \"few and far between\" with Pontypridd, Porth, Ynyshir and Tonyrefail more in demand.\nAnother told me they were very busy with sales to Maerdy but they were mainly people investing in buy-to-let properties.\nMr Montague said: \"We've got a high percentage of home ownership within the community and we do tend to have people living in Maerdy who want to stay here, so we must be doing something right.\"\nAfter speaking to him I met Bill Dacey, a former pub owner from Cardiff who moved to the edge of Maerdy 18 months ago. His wife commutes to work in the city.\n\"I know everyone living 10 doors either side of me,\" he said. \"It's a slower pace of life - but a nice, slow pace of life.\"\nMardy Colliery: What happened after the pit closed?\nMaerdy's new generation and looking to the stars",

The healthy hand then warmed at a considerably faster rate.\n\"This image is striking because it shows so vividly the difference between normal circulation and the poor circulation of someone with Raynaud's disease - triggered by cold temperature, stress and anxiety,\" says head of Wellcome Images and chair of the judging panel, Catherine Draycott.\nScroll down to see the other 19 finalists.\nWiring the human brain\nAlfred Anwander, Max Planck Institute for Human Cognitive and Brain Sciences\nA kaleidoscope of colour reveals a map of pathways inside the brain of a young healthy adult.\nDifferent parts of the brain communicate with each other through nerve fibres - which are colour-coded here.\nUsing a type of magnetic resonance imaging - or MRI - the image was created from mapping virtual slices of the brain, from top to bottom, tracking the direction and movement of water molecules.\n\"We felt it captured the essence of the technique whilst giving a picture of the living brain,\" says Catherine Draycott.\nBlack henna allergy\nNicola Kelley, Cardiff and Vale University Hospital NHS Trust\n\"Here you can see a black henna tattoo on the forearm of a young woman who has suffered an allergic reaction to the dye,\" explains Dirk Pilat, medical director for e-Learning at the Royal College of GPs, and a GP himself.\n\"It's beautifully lit and shows the translucence of the skin that's been raised in blisters, capturing the early stage of the reaction.\"\nDye from the henna plant is commonly used to temporarily stain skin or hair orange-brown, but chemical dyes can be added to turn the colour black.\nHuman stem cell\nS\u00edlvia A Ferreira, Cristina Lopo and Eileen Gentleman, King's College London\n\"This is a scanning electron micrograph of a stem cell taken from the bone marrow inside the hip bone of a healthy person,\" explains Robin Lovell-Badge, a Wellcome awards judge and head of stem cell biology and developmental genetics at the Francis Crick Institute.\n\"This really stood out, we found the natural symmetry alongside the very subtle colouring very striking. It's lovely and sharp.\"\nStem cells can divide to make some of the other types of cells found in the body.\nThis one is about 15 micrometres (0.015mm) across - and before the image could be taken, it was first frozen at cryogenic temperatures (lower than \u2212150C or \u2212238F).\nDividing stem cell in the brain\nPaula Alexandre, University College London\nThis swirling pattern shows different stages of a stem cell splitting in two inside the brain of a zebrafish before it hatches.\nThe circle is about 250 micrometres (0.25mm) wide, and covers a time period of nine hours.\nStarting at about the eight o'clock position, the cell splits to make two different cells found in the brain.\n\"It helps us visualise embryonic development by showing nature's beautifully orchestrated process of stem cell division - producing a new (purple) stem cell and a differentiated (white) nerve cell,\" says Anne Deconinck, executive director of the Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research at MIT, in the US.\nEbola virus\nDavid S Goodsell, RCSB Protein Data Bank\n\"This illustration shows the internal structure of an Ebola virus particle, with the central core in three dimensions so you can see the internal structures more clearly,\" says visual artist Rob Kesseler, professor at Central Saint Martins at the University of the Arts London.\nThe Ebola virus is about 100 nanometres (0.0001mm) wide - 200 times smaller than many of the cells that it infects.\n\"The illustrator chooses pastel colours rather than tonal contrast to show the different elements of this tiny, often lethal virus.\n\"It shows how illustration can uniquely show many different levels of detail simultaneously, with great beauty and clarity.\"\nInfectious disease containment unit\nDavid Bishop, Royal Free Hospital, London\n\"This photograph provides a rare glimpse inside the UKs only high-level isolation unit, taken the day before a nurse was admitted after contracting Ebola,\" says judge Rob Kesseler.\n\"It perfectly captures the calm before the storm, ghostly empty shapes of protective clothing hang, waiting for the patient to be rushed in.\"\nThis special see-through tent surrounds a bed in the Royal Free Hospital in London. All air leaving the unit is cleaned, so the patient can be safely treated without putting other patients or staff at risk.\nNurse Will Pooley made a full recovery.\nSwallowtail butterfly\nDaniel Saftner, Macroscopic Solutions\n\"It was chosen because it shows so clearly what the mouthparts and the eyes of a swallowtail butterfly look like in really striking detail,\" says judge Eric Hilaire, science, environment and global development online picture editor at the Guardian.\nButterflies have two big round eyes for seeing quick movements and two antennae for smelling.\nThey also have a long feeding tube, which is curled up like a spring here, but it unrolls so the butterfly can use it like a straw to drink nectar from flowers.\nMoth scales\nMark R Smith, Macroscopic Solutions\n\"The colour here is actually an optical illusion,\" explains judge Eric Hilaire.\n\"The scales themselves don't contain much pigment, it's the way light bounces off the curves which gives them their apparent colour.\"\nThe scales belong to a Madagascan sunset moth - which sparkles with colour in the light and is often mistaken for a butterfly.\nThis picture is 750 micrometres (0.75mm) wide.\nInside the human eye\nPeter Maloca, University of Basel\n\"Here we're looking inside blood vessels at the back of the human eye, which also supply the retina,\" says judge Robin Lovell-Badge of this 3D picture.\n\"The blood itself is moving too fast to be visible creating this maze of tunnels that looks like a subterranean landscape. It draws your eye towards what appears to be a light at the end.\"\nPictures like this are used by doctors to help spot early signs of eye disease. These tiny tunnels are about 100 micrometres (0.1mm) tall.\nBlood vessels in the eye\nKim Baxter, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust\n\"What's fascinating about this is that, when you see it, you don't automatically think of the eye,\" says judge Rob Kesseler. \"It appears like an aerial view of a city at night or a telescopic image of a distant galaxy.\"\nThe image was created by photographing the blood vessels in the retina - seen here as white spidery lines - as fluorescent dye was passed through.\nDetecting stroke\nNicholas Evans, University of Cambridge\n\"This demonstrates beautifully one of the deadliest two centimetres of pathology in human medicine and is an excellent tool to explain the causation of cerebrovascular accidents, or strokes, to patients,\" explains Dirk Pilat.\nThis medical scan shows, in green, a blocked blood vessel inside the neck of a person.\nThis vessel carries blood to the brain and when it gets blocked, parts of the brain can get damaged and stop working properly.\nCow heart\nMichael Frank, Royal Veterinary College\n\"This image is striking in its three dimensional sculptural appearance, especially when you know that the heart itself is actually a specimen in a jar,\" says Catherine Draycott.\n\"Beautifully lit and photographed to bring to life an old historical specimen - highlighting both the external surface and internal structures.\"\nWindows have been cut into this cow's heart to show what is inside. It is about four times the size of a human heart.\nEngineering human liver tissue\nChelsea Fortin, Kelly Stevens and Sangeeta Bhatia, Koch Institute, MIT\nThis small piece of human liver has been put into a mouse with a damaged liver. The human liver has started to grow, with help from the mouse's blood.\n\"It is tissue engineering in action,\" says Anne Deconinck from the Koch Institute.\n\"In response to tissue damage, cells can reorganise and heal, and even develop much-needed blood vessels.\n\"This image with the heart-shaped patch of engineered liver cells beautifully conveys a message of hope - and the promise of scientific advancements to overcome the challenges of replacement organ shortages and disease, including cirrhosis and liver cancer.\"\nThis image appears as a result of the partnership between Wellcome Images and the Koch Institute at MIT, Cambridge, USA.\nBacteria on graphene oxide\nIzzat Suffian, Kuo-Ching Mei, Houmam Kafa and Khuloud T Al-Jamal, King's College London\n\"This image serves really well to illustrate the fact that graphene, a recently discovered material, is just one atom thick,\" says Catherine Draycott.\n\"The details of the creases in the graphene contrast with the enormous torpedo shaped bacteria, which we know to be very small organisms.\"\nGraphene - seen here in purple - is an extremely thin sheet of carbon, and is one of the thinnest, strongest materials so far discovered.\nResearchers are trying to stick different medicines to it so they can be carried to the right place in the body when needed. The bacteria are about two micrometres (0.002mm) long.\nPremature baby receiving light therapy\nDavid Bishop, Royal Free Hospital, London\nThis baby was born early and has jaundice, a common condition which turns the skin and eyes yellow.\nThe baby is being treated in an incubator at Barnet Hospital in north London, and lies under a blue coloured light, with eyes covered.\n\"One of the reasons this was picked is that it is intimate yet respectful - due to the framing and angle of the photograph,\" says Catherine Draycott.\nClathrin cage\nMaria Voigt, RCSB Protein Data Bank\n\"Clathrin is a protein found in cells, and here molecules of it have come together to form this cage like structure which helps move things around the cell,\" explains judge Eric Hilaire.\n\"The illustration and its shading bring out the three dimensional nature of this structure.\"\nCells can have lots of these tiny cages inside them. This cage measures about 50 nanometres (0.00005mm) across.\nWhen the cage is not being used it breaks up into smaller pieces, which get recycled. The cage can be put back together again when it's next needed.\nToxoplasmosis-causing parasites\nLeandro Lemgruber, University of Glasgow\n\"It looks quite blurry because of the extreme magnification of this tiny parasite which causes toxoplasmosis,\" says judge Robin Lovell-Badge.\n\"This infinitesimally small organism, found in infected cat faeces and raw or undercooked meat, is particularly dangerous to pregnant women and people with weakened immune systems.\"\nHere, DNA inside each parasite (blue/green) is surrounded by membrane (red) and protein (black).\nThis image was created using a type of super-resolution microscopy. Each parasite measures 10 micrometres (0.01mm) long.\nBone development\nFrank Acquaah\n\"Here modern technology is used on historical remains,\" says Catherine Draycott. \"The images are made with micro-computed tomography - penetrating wave scans - which show how the internal structure of the bone evolves as a baby develops in the womb and after birth.\"\nEach circle shows bone from an infant at a different age. The youngest (three months before birth) is on the left and the oldest (2.5 years old) is on the right. These historical bones all come from the skeletons of children who died in the 19th Century.\nMaize leaves\nFernan Federici, Pontificia Universidad Catolica de Chile and University of Cambridge\n\"This image evokes the work of Gustav Klimt with its beautiful, gilded mosaic look,\" says Anne Deconinck from the Koch Institute.\nThis is a confocal micrograph looking inside a cluster of leaves from a young maize (corn) plant.\nEach curled leaf is made up of lots of small cells (small green square and rectangle shapes) - and inside each cell is a nucleus (orange circle), the part of the cell which stores genetic information.\nThe overall winner of the Wellcome Image Awards will be announced on the evening of Tuesday 15 March 2016 at the Science Museum in London -  where all the images will be on display until Sunday 19 June 2016.",

Next week the city will begin to clear out the tracks, but where will the users go?\nAt the top end of Gurney Street in Fairhill, Philadelphia, there's a dirt path that forks through some trees and winds behind an old car repair shop, down to the rail tracks below.\nFollow the path and you'll find a makeshift shooting gallery under a bridge, where heroin addicts gather out of sight and the ground is a sea of used syringes, cookers and needle caps. Users stand around a wooden table to fix, tying on tourniquets and tapping in the crooks of their arms to bring up their veins. One man leans into a mirror to find a spot on his neck, carefully pushing a needle through the skin and rolling back into a chair, his eyes glazing over. Others line up along a long steel beam that forms part of the bridge, unwrapping fresh syringes and preparing to inject. For anyone too nervous, or too far gone, to find a vein, there's a man in a wooden shack a few metres away known as \"the doctor\", who will stick you for a dollar.\nThis is \"El Campamento\", the busiest and most built-up of a handful of hidden-away injection sites along a half-mile stretch of freight track between 2nd Street and Kensington Avenue. For more than 20 years homeless people and drug users have sought refuge in this gulch, and today there are about 70 people living along the tracks and up to 200 passing through every day to shoot up. As nightmarish as it feels, users here say it's a safe place, away from the police and the rest of the public, where people look out for each other and outreach workers visit regularly. Narcan - a nasal spray that reverses overdoses - is never far away.\nBut next week the city will begin to clear this stretch of track and force the users out. After months of negotiations between officials and rail company Conrail, contractors, guarded by police, will enter at the Kensington Avenue end and work their way up, disposing of an estimated 500,000 used needles, tearing down structures, and eventually paving over El Campamento and installing concrete rubble under the bridges to ward off new camps.\n\"If they push us up from here you're gonna have a bunch of junkies on the streets looking for somewhere else to shoot up,\" said Luis, a 41-year-old father-of-two with dark, matted hair and dull eyes, who asked us not to use his real name.\nLuis wakes up every morning in a rickety wooden shack and spends his days, like the doctor, injecting other users. The fee is one dollar or one sixth of a heroin shot, and most people pay in heroin. Every six injections Luis can do a hit of his own. For 22 months he was clean, until his wife had a heart attack in the bath and drowned.\nPerched on a concrete barrier on Gurney Street, he squinted against the sun, opening and closing a flick knife in one hand and letting a cigarette slowly burn away in the other. \"I had everything,\" he said. \"I had a beautiful life, I had a beautiful wife. In the blink of an eye it got took from me. That was a year and a week ago.\"\nDays later he was down on the tracks. \"At least down here you know you can get safe dope, you can get clean works, you can get high and nobody's gonna mess with you,\" he said. \"If they board this up I have to start again. I have to find a new place I can lay my head at night where I don't have to sleep with one eye open.\"\nWalking the half-mile length of track last week, person after person along the way said they would just find another hole in Kensington, the neighbourhood around the tracks, a place already gripped by poverty and overrun by heroin.\nKensington was once a vibrant industrial area that people came to from around Philadelphia in search of work. As the manufacturing trades died away, employment rates and house prices plummeted, homes were abandoned and boarded up and the drug trade moved in. Now people come to Kensington from around the city, state and country in search of heroin. The area is said to be the largest open-air drugs market on the East Coast.\nOn nearly every block on the short walk from Gurney Street to Hope Park, dealers call out their brands - \"So Fly\", \"Caution\", \"Cowboy\" - and empty packets stamped with logos litter the way. The heroin sold here is among the purest, cheapest, and most lethal in the US. It courses through the veins of the place, turning public parks, churches, abandoned houses and street corners into venues to shoot up.\nBefore the deal was struck to clear the tracks, the city cleared out McPherson Square, a small park on Kensington Avenue that had become a haunt for addicts. At the centre of the square is the local library, and when national media reported in May that librarians were being trained to revive overdosed users in the square - rechristened Needle Park by locals - it was enough. The drug users were driven out.\n\"Back in '70 this was a beautiful park,\" said Joe Grone, a 53-year-old who moved to the edge  of McPherson Square more than 40 years ago. He was pricked in the ankle by a used needle as he walked through the park last year, as was his five-year-old granddaughter as she sat on their front steps. \"This place should be for kids, not for needles,\" he said.\nNow a large mobile police unit sits near the middle of McPherson Square and officers roll around the perimeter on bikes. Last week, children were running around again, jumping through a sprinkler and screaming with delight. Save for the odd syringe cap nestled in the grass, it was a happy afternoon in Needle Park.\nBut drug outreach workers here question where the users went. Shortly after the square was cleared, there were reports that an abandoned church on Westmoreland Street had become a haven for addicts. Police moved in to clear the church too, and in the sanctuary, Kate Perch, a housing co-ordinator for local outreach charity Prevention Point, found a young couple in the grip of addiction. They had fashioned a makeshift home around a mattress and hidden their belongings under the organ pipes. As the police waited, the couple discussed different abandoned row houses in the area, debating which were safe.\n\"That's a conversation which will keep happening in this neighbourhood,\" Ms Perch said. \"McPherson has been cleared, Westmoreland has been cleared, now the tracks are about to get cleared. What happens to these people when that site is no longer available? Where will they go that is safe?\"\nThe worry for people like Ms Perch is that vulnerable users will be pushed into the city's hundreds of abandoned houses - \"abandos\" - where it is too dangerous for outreach workers to go, where people will overdose and no one will see.\nThe city is already predicting a 30% increase in overdoses this year, for the second year running, taking the grim toll from 900 to 1,200 - four times the estimated number of murders. Fentanyl - a tranquiliser 50 to 100 times more powerful than heroin which has been linked to deaths across the country - has taken hold, infecting the supply of heroin that floods into Philadelphia from the ports.\n\"The dope that's out there now... it's fentanyl, it's elephant tranquiliser, it's rat poison, stuff like that,\" said James Russell, a 30-year-old local with a 15-year heroin habit, who shakily made a cup of instant coffee as he waited for a check-up at Prevention Point.\n\"The way a lot of the fiends are here now, you hear someone shot a bag of dope and overdosed and seven out of 10 people rush to go find that dope. It's insane.\"\nJose Ojeda flew to Philadelphia full of hope. He came as an addict, seeking first-class treatment in the heart of the city. That's what they told him in Puerto Rico. But like thousands of others who had made the flight before him, he was heading for one of the city's unlicensed recovery houses, where users are exploited for their benefits and many wash out into the street, ending up places like the tracks.\n\"I'm searching for help but it's impossible for me because I don't have papers,\" said Jose, looking away as he spoke across an empty lot by the tracks, his eyes bloodshot, skin rough and needle-marked, one hand tightly cramped against his will. His ID was stolen with his wallet while he was passed out, he said. He thinks a lot about his mother who died in Puerto Rico while he was in Philadelphia, and about his daughter and his granddaughter who are still there.\n\"I'm trapped here now with my worn-out hands. I don't know how to speak English, I go places to ask for help and they don't understand me. It pushes me to drugs,\" he said.\nWithout ID he can't get treatment and he can't get home. At 42, he's stuck in Kensington, a long way from home, with a heroin habit he can't shake.\nEven with ID, the barriers to treatment in Philadelphia are high. The city has an estimated 70,000 active heroin users and fewer than 15,000 treatment options at any given time, adding every different type together. The Housing-First programme will put a roof over the head of users without demanding they are clean, but there are currently fewer than 40 slots available in the Kensington area for about 400 homeless people.\nThe city has pledged an additional $250,000 to supportive housing and is planning a three-day \"resources fair\" on an empty lot on Gurney Street, to coincide with the track closure, but police will be in attendance and mistrust among users is endemic. Even if there were treatment options here for everyone, many in the grip of addiction are simply unwilling or unable to seek them.\n\"Addiction is a stigma driven disease in this country,\" said Roland Lamb, deputy commissioner at the city's Department of Behavioural Health and Intellectual Disability Services (DBHIS). \"A person who is addicted only has about a one in 10 chance of getting the treatment they need.\"\nDBHIS is working with city-funded outreach groups like Prevention Point, in an attempt to engage with users before the track clearout. The charity began life 25 years ago as an underground needle exchange and two years ago moved into an old brownstone Methodist church in the heart of Kensington, a few blocks from the tracks. Hundreds of users travel to the building from all corners of the neighbourhood and beyond, for a check-up, a pack of clean needles or just a chat, and for a few hours every day the old church has a congregation of sorts.\n\"This place is a blessing,\" said Laura, a 41-year-old regular who endured 15 years of homelessness, drug addiction and prostitution before getting clean and finding a place in shelter. \"When I first came here I was deep in my addiction,\" she said. \"They save lives here every day.\"\nBut not everyone is grateful. Prevention Point has faced resistance from local officials and residents, who say it draws addicts to the area. The clean needles they give out undoubtedly save lives - HIV infections from drug use in the city have dropped from 50% to just 5% since the charity began its work - but some people were putting them to use immediately on the streets outside the building.\nJose Benitez is executive director at Prevention Point. \"The community's approach is 'we don't want this in our neighbourhood', the city's approach 'oh my god something must be done',\" he said. \"The trick is, what's the something?\"\nAs word spread that the tracks would be cleared, fear and anger began to surface in local Facebook groups. Philadelphia should \"start executing drug dealers on the spot\", wrote one resident. \"Better solution, if someone comes into an emergency room full of heroin, let them DIE,\" wrote another. \"DEAD IS BEST,\" someone replied.\nThe aggression worried Dan Martino, co-founder of a local grassroots group, Philadelphia Overdose Prevention Initiative (Popi). On the second Wednesday in June, Mr Martino went to Mick's Inn, a narrow, wood-panelled corner bar in Port Richmond, next to Kensington, where 30 or so local residents had gathered to discuss what would happen when the tracks were purged. After an hour or so of listening, he stood up to speak.\nHe asked the residents if they would be interested in a solution which would lower the death rate by 30%. They murmured yes. He asked if they would like to see lower crime rates and needles off the streets and they agreed. Then he said he was talking about safe injection sites, and the atmosphere in the room turned. Two women stormed out. When the meeting spilled into the street Mr Martino approached one of them. Her daughter had died of an overdose, and she told Mr Martino she would shoot him if she found he was giving addicts a place to inject.\nFor some people around these neighbourhoods, safe injection sites - where users can test their drugs and inject in the presence of medical staff - are the last remaining hope. To others, they are unthinkable - a final nail in the coffin for a neighbourhood killed by heroin.\n\"When I first started advocating for this there was a wall of resistance. People who would yell at me like I've never been yelled at by adult,\" Mr Martino said. \"But these people are going to use one way or the other. That's just the reality we live in. We live in a world of heroin. Until we can find a way to stop it coming in from the ports, this is what we have to do.\"\nThe woman who threatened to shoot him was Kathleen Costello Berry, a lifelong Port Richmond local whose daughter overdosed at just 17 and was left in a hospital parking lot to die. \"I just had to leave, I couldn't even listen to him speak,\" she recalled.\n\"I lost my daughter. If anyone had dared to tell me she could come somewhere safe to shoot up and we'll keep an eye on her\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6\" She trailed off, her voice cracking. \"No. No way. There is no safe way to shoot poison into your veins.\"\nThere are no safe injection sites in America, yet. As the nation's opioid epidemic spirals, several major cities, including Seattle, San Francisco, and New York, are beginning to consider taking the leap, but there is fierce political resistance to the idea.\nThere is one such site in Canada though, in Vancouver, and statistics suggest it has stemmed the tide of dead bodies there. More than 700 injections take place every day in 13 mirrored booths and no one has died at the facility since it opened in 2003. The clinic estimates that it has prevented 5,000 fatal overdoses. But the then-Conservative government fought it all the way to the Supreme Court.\nIn Philadelphia, a new opioid task force will \"further explore\" the possibility, said a spokesman for Mayor James Kenney, citing \"serious legal, practical, and law enforcement issues that have to be considered\" first.\nSome local officials remain opposed. \"It's taken a long time for us to hit rock bottom here,\" said Maria Quinones Sanchez, councilwoman for the city's 7th district, which encompasses Kensington. \"Do we want to now send a message that you can come here and buy the cheapest drugs available and then actually have a place to use them?\"\nBut the current strategy - clearing out one park, church, or railway gulch and pushing people to the next - doesn't appear to be working. It has created a grim merry-go-round in Kensington that threatens to cause yet more lonely deaths. Consumed by addiction, and unready for treatment, most people along the tracks will continue to slip through the net.\n\"Heroin is what's killing people, but not giving people the opportunity to say help me, not giving people the opportunity to seek treatment - that keeps them in the basement, it keeps them in places like the tracks,\" said Mr Martino.\n\"These people don't want to die, despite their best efforts. They don't want to live like this.\"\nDown at the tracks last week, life was going on as usual. After so many delays, few people seemed to believe that the bulldozers would really roll through. But the rail company's deadline to start work is the end of the month, and the city has had enough.\nLuis was still injecting people and getting high off the profits, enough to dull the pain of the anniversary, a few days earlier, of his wife's death. He couldn't see a way out.\n\"I'll just try and break through the fence and come back in,\" he said. \"I ain't got no place else to go. It's here or nowhere.\"\nA few feet away under the bridge, by the fixing table, another user, Manuel, shifted his weight from foot to foot and stared off into the distance, pushing a baseball cap absent-mindedly up and down his forehead. He recalled doing his first hit ever of heroin, years ago, by the tracks. \"This is where I started, it's the only place I've ever come to,\" he said. \"If this place wasn't here maybe it would be easier for me to stop.\n\"It's like my legs carry me here by themselves. If they close down these tracks, I dunno. I hope my legs take me somewhere better.\"",

    "text": "We know all about the likes of Zlatan Ibrahimovic and Sadio Mane - two of the highest-profile deals so far - but what of the lesser-known imports to the English game?\nWho, for example, comes from the land of 'the great chess players?' Who has become the fourth most expensive Nigerian player of all time?\nAnd who used to work as a butcher for 30 euros a week? This is your essential guide to what we can expect from the Premier League's lower-profile additions this summer.\nGranit Xhaka, Borussia Monchengladbach to Arsenal\nAge: 23 Cost: \u00a335m Position: Midfielder\nCareer so far: Made his professional debut with Basel in his native Switzerland and won two league titles and one domestic cup before moving to Monchengladbach in 2012. During four years with the German club he picked up 23 yellow cards and five reds, and captained the side to fourth place in the Bundesliga.\nWhat type of player is he? A combative yet creative midfielder known for his vision, accurate passing and hard tackling. He was second only to Xabi Alonso for completed passes in last season's Bundesliga, yet he also managed to get sent off three times for his club last term.\nWill he cut it in the Premier League? Arsenal and Arsene Wenger certainly think so. Could be a star of the 2016-17 campaign.\nWhat has been said about him? Ottmar Hitzfeld, the former Switzerland manager, called him the 'young Bastian Schweinsteiger'.\nAge: 23 Cost: \u00a34.7m Position: Goalkeeper\nCareer so far: Made his Bundesliga debut with Mainz aged 19 and by the following season had become first-choice goalkeeper. Played every league game last season, saving two penalties and keeping nine clean sheets.\nWhat type of player is he? Describes himself as \"a modern, offensive goalkeeper\", who is \"willing to take risks\".\nWill he cut it in the Premier League? He cost almost exactly half the fee Liverpool paid for Simon Mignolet in 2013, but after a mixed three seasons at Anfield, Karius could well usurp his more experienced, more expensive rival and start the season as first choice.\nWhat has been said about him? Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp: \"He has developed into a very good goalkeeper since his return to Germany. I know he will add to the quality we have in this position.\"\nAge: 26 Cost: Free Position: Defensive midfielder\nCareer so far: After reaching the Norwegian Cup final with FK Haugesund at the end of his debut season he was signed by Arsenal aged 17. But in four years with the north London club he did not play a single game and left for Monchengladbach after a series of loan spells in Spain, Germany and his homeland. He missed just three league matches last season as Monchengladbach came fourth, and played in all six of the side's games in the Champions League group stage.\nWhat type of player is he? He began his career as a defender but Nordtveit played the majority of last season as a defensive midfielder - alongside new Arsenal signing Xhaka - although he can also feature at centre-back and right-back.\nWill he cut it in the Premier League? Nordtveit will feel he has something to prove having missed out on a chance to play in the English top flight during his years at Arsenal, and his consistently impressive performances in Germany and in Europe suggest he is well placed to do just that.\nWhat has been said about him? Monchengladbach boss Andre Schubert: \"He has a great strength of will and there's a lot of power and energy in his game. He has a brilliant mentality and takes on every challenge, regardless of which position he's in and where he's needed.\"\nAge: 26 Cost: Free Position: Attacking midfielder/winger\nCareer so far: Plays for Algeria but was born in France and began his career with Grenoble before moving to Valencia in 2010. He made 202 appearances during six years with the Spanish club, scoring 31 goals and providing 40 assists. He was a key part of Algeria's run to the last 16 of the World Cup in 2014.\nWhat type of player is he? His lightning pace and quick feet have been key for Valencia in recent years, but he was one of many who struggled in a campaign last season that saw Gary Neville fired from his first attempt in management. Missed the end of last season after being suspended by the club amid reports he refused to take part in a warm-down.\nWill he cut it in the Premier League? The Hammers will be hoping Feghouli can bring the best of his creative flair into the English top flight, much in the same way as Dimitri Payet did in his debut season after joining from Marseille last year. Like Payet, he has undoubted ability, but there are question marks over his consistency after a disappointing 2015-16.\nWhat has been said about him? West Ham co-chairman David Gold: \"The arrival of Feghouli shows the ambition we have got and this is a steady progress. We all saw what Riyad Mahrez did for Leicester last season and we hope that Sofiane can have a similar impact.\"\nAge: 22 Cost: \u00a330m Position: Defender\nCareer so far: Began his professional career with Spanish club Espanyol before moving to Villarreal for a reported \u00a34.8m in January 2015 as a replacement for Gabriel Paulista, who had joined Arsenal. He has played 15 times for Ivory Coast, with whom he won the Africa Cup of Nations in 2015.\nWhat type of player is he? Aggressive, quick, strong, good in the air and with his feet, Bailly was sorely missed as Villarreal were beaten 3-0 away by Liverpool in last season's Europa League semi-final second leg.\nWill he cut it in the Premier League? All the signs suggest he will. Bailly caught the eye with some really strong displays against Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Neymar and Karim Benzema as Villarreal finished fourth in La Liga last year. He has the physical attributes to succeed and the hope will be that, under Jose Mourinho, the finer sides of his defensive game continue to develop at Old Trafford.\nWhat has been said about him? United manager Jose Mourinho: \"Eric is a young central defender with great natural talent. He has progressed well to date and has the potential to become one of the best around.\"\nAge: 25 Cost: Reported \u00a320m Position: Midfielder\nCareer so far: Began his career with Bochum's reserve side before moving to Nurnberg in 2009 and on to Borussia Dortmund for a reported \u00a33.4m in 2011. There, under manager Jurgen Klopp, he won the German league and cup double in 2012 and was a Champions League finalist in 2013. He has had injury problems since though, missing all but the first game of the 2013-14 season with a back problem. He is currently recovering from a dislocated knee.\nWhat type of player is he? A deep-lying Germany midfielder with a Turkish background, Gundogan is admired for his close control, vision and passing range. In 157 games for Dortmund he scored 15 goals and provided 21 assists.\nWill he cut it in the Premier League? Gundogan has already proved he has the ability to compete at the highest level, both with Dortmund in the German top flight and with the national team.\nWhat has been said about him? City director of football Txiki Begiristain: \"He is an intelligent and versatile midfielder who can operate in a number of different roles. He will be a very important player for us in the coming years.\"\nAge: 27 Cost: Free Position: Defender\nCareer so far: Graduated from Real Madrid's youth system but never played for the Spanish giants. Instead his breakthrough came at Sporting Gijon, where he spent two years in the reserves before being promoted to the first team in 2012.\nWhat type of player is he? A ball-playing centre-back who is used to being busy - his side only just stayed up last season.\nWill he cut it in the Premier League? Difficult to be definitive about this because last season was Hernandez's first and only top-flight campaign - and Gijon escaped relegation only by a point thanks to a 2-0 win on the final day.\nIn his own words: \"Yesterday I took off [the shirt] for the last time and I feel that these red and white stripes will be stuck to me forever,\" on his final game for Sporting.\nAge: 23 Cost: Reported \u00a32m Position: Defender\nCareer so far: Made his professional debut with FC Utrecht at the age of 18 and was named their player of the year in his third and final season before joining Ajax in 2013 for a reported \u00a33.2m. Spent the first half of last season on the bench but was a regular in the run-in as Ajax narrowly missed out on the Dutch title. Has made 13 appearances for the Netherlands Under-21 side, scoring once.\nWhat type of player is he? A 6ft 2in centre-back who has scored 10 goals in 90 games in Dutch club football.\nWill he cut it in the Premier League? Remains to be seen if he plays regularly. Only got 15 Eredivisie games for Ajax last season but will have Ashley Williams alongside him to guide his development.\nIn his own words: \"I hope to improve and bring competition to the defensive position. Ashley Williams is a really good defender. Hopefully I can learn from him.\"\nAge: 27 Cost: \u00a326m (reported) Position: Attacking midfielder\nCareer so far: Started in his homeland of Armenia with Pyunik, before spells with Metalurh and Shakhtar Donetsk. Joined Dortmund three years ago, scoring 23 goals in 88 Bundesliga appearances. Had a hand in 49 goals (23 goals, 26 assists) in 52 games for Dortmund last season.\nWhat type of player is he? Plays most of his football as an attacking midfielder, but can also play in a deeper midfield role, on the wing or just off a striker. An expert passer and finisher, as his stats for last season show.\nWill he cut it in the Premier League? Has all the characteristics needed to be one of the stars of the Premier League. However, a word of caution - the last Dortmund playmaker that United signed was Shinji Kagawa, who only lasted two years at Old Trafford.\nWhat has been said about him? \"He is one of the most talented players in the world. He possesses an incredible combination of speed and technique. There's very, very few you can say that about. There's a reason why the world's best chess players come from Armenia like Mkhitaryan. They're thinkers, they're hard workers, they graft,\" Jurgen Klopp in 2015.\nAge: 25 Cost: \u00a312m (reported) Position: Midfielder\nCareer so far: Has spent most of his career in the Netherlands, with Sparta Rotterdam and Heerenveen. Joined Atalanta for a reported \u00a31m last summer and leaves after one goal in 36 Serie A appearances.\nWhat type of player is he? A defensive midfielder who loves a tackle - illustrated by nine bookings last season. He was top of Serie A's rankings for tackles - and second for interceptions - last season. Don't expect many goals, he's only ever notched 11.\nWill he cut it in the Premier League? This type of disciplined, defensive midfielder often shines in the Premier League, so he could be key for Boro - but there is a long list of Serie A players who never adapted to English football.\nIn his own words: \"On the pitch, something clicks and I become a different person. I enjoy standing on someone's toes every now and then or whispering in someone's ear if they do something wrong or miss a chance,\" he said in a Youtube video this year.\nAge: 19 Cost: \u00a31.7m (reported) Position: Attacking midfielder\nCareer so far: Came through the youth team at Shakhtar Donetsk before moving to Ufa in Russia, scoring twice in 31 league games. Was added to Ukraine's Euro 2016 squad after reportedly being offered Russian citizenship, and played all three games in France.\nWhat type of player is he? The talented youngster can play in any midfield position, and has also featured at left-back. A Ukrainian James Milner?\nWill he cut it in the Premier League? Maybe in the future, but City fans should perhaps not expect to see him near the first team soon as he has been linked with a loan switch to PSV Eindhoven.\nWhat has been said about him? \"Zinchenko is talented, but he must be realistic. He must get experience and game practice. He can only play for Manchester City on PlayStation,\" said former Ukraine and Liverpool striker Andriy Voronin last month.\nAge: 22 Cost: \u00a333m (reported) Position: Striker\nCareer so far: Was released by Anderlecht in 2007 for being too hard to handle. Two and a half seasons as a regular at Standard Liege got him a \u00a34.5m move to Marseille in 2014. Was fourth top scorer in Ligue 1 last season with 17 goals, despite being back-up to Steven Fletcher at one stage, angering - among others - Basile Boli.\nWhat type of player is he? A proper striker, who has pace and power, can finish well and is decent in the air despite his relative lack of height at 5ft 11in. His attitude has been questioned in the past and he doesn't consider passing to a team-mate if going alone is on the cards.\nWill he cut it in the Premier League? Has all the qualities one looks for in a Premier League striker. Will surely get more of a chance than Chelsea's last Belgium striker, Romelu Lukaku, although if he does half as well as another signing from Marseille, Didier Drogba, then he will be a Blues hero.\nWhat has been said about him? \"I think his move is absolutely brilliant. Michy is being rewarded for his great form and the work he has done out here and over the past season,\" said Belgium boss Marc Wilmots during Euro 2016.\nAge: 24 Cost: \u00a313m (reported) Position: Midfielder\nCareer so far: Helped Monaco win promotion from Ligue 2 in 2012-13 under now Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri, but annoyed his manager by then leaving for Nice - where he spent three seasons before moving to the Foxes. Has only ever scored once in 201 games.\nWhat type of player is he? The fact he gets compared to Claude Makelele is a good clue that he's a defensive midfielder who likes tackles and simple passes. Despite his love of a tackle, he has only been sent off twice in over 200 appearances, so shouldn't be a liability.\nWill he cut it in the Premier League? From the scouting team who brought in N'Golo Kante from Ligue 1 a year ago, you have to back Leicester to know a potential Premier League midfielder when they see one.\nWhat has been said about him? \"I do not understand his attitude. As soon as I saw him play, I said here is our Claude Makelele. I trusted him and I played him,\" Ranieri told L'Equipe when Mendy left Monaco in 2013.\nAge: 20 Cost: \u00a312.5m (reported) Position: Forward\nCareer so far: Still only 20, all of Success' first-team football has come for Granada, for whom he scored seven goals in 49 La Liga games.\nWhat type of player is he? Can play on either wing or as a striker. Has pace to burn and plenty of strength. Scored six La Liga goals and assisted another five last season, and that was from out wide in a struggling team.\nWill he cut it in the Premier League? There's no reason why not, but if Watford keep hold of Troy Deeney and Odion Ighalo, Success may have to play deeper or be an impact substitute unless new coach Walter Mazzarri plays a three-man front line.\nWhat has been said about him? \"Success is a very good player, he has power, he has the physical characteristics to play in England, but he's younger and we need to think about the future of this player,\" said Quique Sanches Flores, then the Watford manager, speaking in February.\nAge: 31 Cost: \u00a31.5m (reported) Position: Goalkeeper\nCareer so far: Started off at Le Havre before joining Marseille in 2007, going on to make 439 appearances. Won the French title with the club in 2010 and has been named Ligue 1 goalkeeper of the year four times, including each of the past two seasons. Had been their captain since 2010.\nWhat type of player is he? An excellent goalkeeper as well as a leader of men. A great shot stopper, who is confident at dealing with crosses. Has saved three Ligue 1 penalties in the last three seasons.\nWill he cut it in the Premier League? Almost certainly, if he is Palace's number one ahead of Wayne Hennessey. Only missed two Ligue 1 games in his last six years for Marseille and is entering his peak years as a keeper.\nWhat has been said about him? \"He'd be France's number one if it wasn't for Hugo Lloris. You just have to look at his record to see he's a top keeper - he brings experience into that position as well,\" said Palace assistant boss Keith Millen.\nAge: 29 Cost: \u00a313.8m Position: Forward\nCareer so far: Joined Barcelona's B team at the age of 22 after starting his career in the lower leagues. After two La Liga appearances for Barca's first team, he went on to play for Benfica, Granada and Celta Vigo. He was the second-most prolific Spaniard in La Liga over the last three seasons with 39 goals and Barca tried to re-sign him in January.\nWhat type of player is he? Plays out wide on the left, with plenty of pace and tricks - and likes to cut inside onto his right foot and get a shot in - he scored 12 in La Liga last season.\nWill he cut it in the Premier League? Pep Guardiola managed the Spaniard at Barcelona so if he thinks he can, he must have something to offer. Was one of Spain's sharpest players at Euro 2016, but might be involved in some rotation among City's star-studded squad and is unlikely to start every game.\nWhat has been said about him? \"We've brought him because of the season he's had and because he's a specialist on the wing - there aren't many players like him. Defensively speaking he also helps out his full-back and he was one of our best options for the wide positions,\" then-Spain boss Vicente del Bosque told Marca about his decision to bring him to Euro 2016.\nFind all the latest football transfers on our dedicated page.",

    "text": "Champions Chelsea had two players sent off as Antonio Conte's side lost at home to Burnley.\nNew signing Romelu Lukaku scored twice as Manchester United got their campaign off to a flying start with a big win against West Ham.\nPremier League debutants Huddersfield produced the perfect away performance to beat Crystal Palace but there were defeats for fellow new boys Newcastle, against Tottenham, and Brighton, at home to Manchester City.\nYou can see the thinking behind my team below but, first, here's who BBC Sport readers have picked in their team of the week:\nIf you haven't had a go yet, you can still pick your own team of the week from the shortlist selected by BBC Sport journalists and share it with your friends.\nPick your XI from our list and share with your friends.\nIf you can't see the selector, please use this link to pick your XI.\nI thought that Wilfried Zaha missed a glorious chance to put Palace back into their game against Huddersfield. However, when I saw the television replay, it was crystal clear that Jonas Lossl somehow got his foot to the ball to divert what was actually an excellent strike around the post for a corner.\nIf that wasn't a game changer, then the header from Christian Benteke that followed was. It was vintage centre-forward play from the Belgian striker but equalled only by a superb save from the Danish keeper.\nIt was obvious to me that Lossl's intention was to keep a clean sheet at all costs. Lots of goalkeepers may have that intention when they start a match but it's not always matched by their performance. Lossl was sensational and another excellent addition to a side who will need a few more results like this one at Selhurst Park if they intend to retain their Premier League status.\nAs for Palace, losing at home to Liverpool, for example, is one thing but a 3-0 defeat by Huddersfield is another matter entirely. The newly installed Frank de Boer only lasted 85 days as manager of Inter Milan - and if the Eagles suffer many more defeats like this, the Dutchman could find himself surpassing even that dismal record and staring at another P45 very quickly.\nI would no sooner have paid \u00a350m for Kyle Walker than I would to fly to the moon but I can see why Pep Guardiola did. How else was Guardiola going to get Spurs to let this particularly athletic full-back join their rivals? Unless, of course, he was prepared to offer Tottenham something quite outrageous in order to bolster his chances of winning the Premier League title? After all that's what's at stake.\nAgainst a courageous Brighton and Hove Albion, who defended as though their lives depended on it, Walker looked every inch the player Guardiola would have wanted: comfortable on the ball, patient in defence and in no particular hurry to demonstrate to the viewing audience that he was worth the money.\nThat said, Brighton didn't do an awful lot to test him but that wasn't the defender's fault. This is a massive season for Walker, especially with him having walked out of Spurs. To win nothing now, having taken such a serious step, would be a disaster for both manager and player.\nThere were a number of sparkling performances for Spurs against Newcastle at St James' Park.\nChristian Eriksen practically ran the show, Kyle Walker-Peters looks like a star in the making but it was Toby Alderweireld's quiet authority at the back that set the tone for Tottenham's victory.\nIn the absence of marquee signings at Tottenham this summer, it must come as a relief to many that they have retained the services of the Belgium international.\nDanny Rose may have been forced to apologise for his remarks regarding a lack of summer spending at the club and I have some sympathy with his position. The transfer window is not yet closed but the point has been made.\nIf, as media reports suggest, Spurs are to spend something in the region of \u00a385m during the next couple of weeks, then it could be another impressive season for them. It was an impressive away victory on Sunday.\nIt was good to see Phil Jones fit and playing in a Manchester United shirt again.\nHe has suffered more than his fair share of injuries over the years but if Jose Mourinho intends to challenge for the title this season then he is going to need a fully-fit Jones.\nThe former Blackburn defender can no longer go crashing into every challenge as though his life depends on it. Of course, it's every defender's dream to leave something on his opponent but Jones has to wise up. Picking his tackles is a vital pre-requisite if he intends to be part of a title-winning team under Mourinho.\nOf all the central defenders at Old Trafford, Jones is the most comfortable on the ball. Chris Smalling is a warrior and Eric Bailly a great support act but if Jones can start to play with his head and not just his heart, United could be in for one hell of a season.\nIt was an excellent performance by Stephen Ward at Chelsea.\nThe full-back played with a confidence and composure reminiscent of another former Burnley left-back and England international, Keith Newton.\nWard took his goal brilliantly on Saturday, in what was anything but a spiteful game; nevertheless seven players were booked and two sent off.\nWhat this game signified to me was that players such as Newton (as good as he was) could not play in the modern era because of the inflexibility of referees such as Craig Pawson, who seem incapable of recognising a mistimed tackle as opposed to a dangerous one. Frankly, I've seen better decisions made by a Grade 4 referee on a Sunday afternoon.\nPawson couldn't possibly have played the game at any serious level, having made the decision to send off Chelsea captain Gary Cahill for what was no more than a clumsy challenge. A yellow card was all that was required.\nWhile Pawson may be popular with his peers for appearing brave, his hubris has put Stephen Ward and all defenders at risk of an early bath because of nothing more than their impetuousness.\nIs that the future?\nIf you blinked then you would have missed it. Wayne Rooney's 'hand off' on Stoke midfielder Joe Allen as he ran into the box to score Everton's winner was simply genius. It propelled Rooney forward towards the penalty area - and it denied Allen the momentum to stop the Everton man getting the return pass that lead to a brilliantly taken header.\nIt is the finer details that make all the difference in a tightly contested Premier League encounter, and the game against Stoke couldn't have been much finer.\nRegular readers of my team of the week will know only too well the high regard in which I hold Rooney. His services to game and country have been exemplary over the years and it is fitting that he should return home to Goodison Park, where it all started for him, to signal the coming to an end of an illustrious career.\nEverton fans deserve this finale.\nWhen I read that Manchester United had bought Nemanja Matic, I thought it was a misprint.\nAs far as I was concerned, it was inconceivable that Chelsea would sell a player of Matic's calibre, particularly as they have four major competitions to contest this season. Why on earth would Antonio Conte sanction such a thing? Matic must be among the top 10 best holding midfield players in the world. Why would you sell him, especially to one of your arch-rivals?\nI watched Matic on numerous occasions during his time at Stamford Bridge, and while he didn't have a blistering season, he played a fundamental role in Chelsea winning the title.\nNo sooner had the hangover from the title celebrations subsided, than Matic was off to United producing what can only be described as a majestic debut performance. West Ham were blown away as Matic provided Paul Pogba with the freedom to roam, Henrikh Mkhitaryan with the freedom to probe and Juan Mata to do just whatever he liked.\nLanding Matic has been an extraordinary piece of business by Manchester United and that is why I have tipped them for the title.\nWithin minutes of the game beginning at St James' Park, it was obvious to me that Newcastle had targeted Dele Alli.\nI can understand the reasons why, because the Tottenham player has the ability to hurt teams. He is emotionally fragile and still has a lot of growing up to do, and he can be easily riled - or so I thought. Instead, Alli's conduct was so professional that I was beginning to wonder if he had lost some of his menace.\nNevertheless, Newcastle continued to niggle away at the Young Player of the Year until they went just a little too far. Precisely why Jonjo Shelvey decided to resort to the behaviour of a bar room thug, and stamp on Alli, I can't quite understand, particularly as Newcastle had already won the free-kick.\nHowever, to see Alli not only keep his cool but also make Newcastle pay for their captain's indiscipline by scoring an exceptional goal must have given Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino enormous satisfaction.\nAs for Shelvey, he should seriously consider doing something other than continually embarrassing Rafael Benitez and the fans of Newcastle United. It's a great city with a great team and they both deserve a great captain - not a thug in a Newcastle shirt.\nWe saw flashes of this form from Stefano Okaka last season. However, his performance against a resilient Liverpool was a step up from anything I have seen from the Italian before. His goal was well-taken but his overall play was very impressive.\nThis was another one of those performances where Watford appeared to be punching above their weight - and at times making mincemeat, especially on set-pieces, out of a team with far greater resources.\nThe Hornets have secured the services of Marco Silva to see them through this season's activities. It would be refreshing to see the executives at Watford exercise a little restraint when deciding the future of their managers. This incessant chopping and changing of the boss for no apparent reason is becoming tiresome.\nThis was quite a performance by Romelu Lukaku on his Premier League debut for Manchester United.\nIf you were an Everton fan, it must have been a difficult watch seeing your former hero putting the finishing touches to an impressive team performance for the Red Devils. However, I can't help feeling it was the right move for all concerned.\nEverton got the money (and his goals) while United got their man. The Belgian's game reminds me of Didier Drogba the more I see him, and that was precisely why Jose Mourinho bought him. Who knows the value of a player with Drogba's potential better than Mourinho?\nTo snatch the Belgium international from under the gaze of Chelsea, who clearly wanted him, must have left a very sweet taste in Mourinho's mouth. He knows only too well what Antonio Conte could do with a player such as Lukaku at his disposal.\nNow Chelsea have lost the striker and look like losing Diego Costa into the bargain - all because of Conte's impetuousness and inability to resist sending his top goalscorer a text stating his services were no longer required before he knew he had Lukaku in the bag. Mourinho must be falling about with laughter.\nIf a promoted side are going to stand any chance of survival in the Premier League, they need to have a goalscorer.\nSteve Mounie scored plenty at Montpellier but whoever decided that the Benin international could perform the same duties in the Premier League must really know a striker when they see one.\nMounie was superb against Crystal Palace. There were a number of clubs in England who took a look at him but weren't prepared to take a chance. David Wagner did and we all can see why now.\nThe striker scored two brilliant goals and should have crowned his performance with a hat-trick. It wasn't just his goals that impressed either, it was his all-round general hold up play.\nThat will prove a very important feature especially when the goals dry up - and they will at some stage. He wasn't the only player that caught my eye in the Huddersfield line-up either. Aaron Mooy looks a player and, along with Mounie, could be Huddersfield's ticket to another season in the big time.",

    "text": "Wenger has become an increasingly divisive figure among Arsenal fans in recent years but has agreed to remain at the club in the after-glow of an historic seventh FA Cup win at the club after Saturday's 2-1 win against Chelsea at Wembley.\nIt was a success that added to his three Premier League titles, including two domestic doubles, and six Charity and Community Shields, ensuring he could play a strong hand in Monday's meeting with Arsenal owner Stan Kroenke that finally ended a tortuous, acrimonious period of uncertainty over his future.\nA section of Arsenal's support have organised protest marches and made their discontent clear as Wenger's side once again failed to halt a barren title sequence stretching back to \"The Invincibles\" season of 2003/04 - with the manager describing some of his treatment as \"a disgrace.\"\nSo will the wounds heal in the next phase of the Wenger era? And is this the right decision for Wenger and Arsenal?\nWenger says he will \"never forget\" some of the criticism he has endured this season, clearly believing he should have been afforded more respect given his track record.\nHe delivered a very clear message to his detractors, and indeed Arsenal's board, when he said after the FA Cup Final win: \"It is not about popularity. It is about competence.\"\nWenger's competence has been questioned by some this season but Saturday's win, when Premier League champions Chelsea were overpowered and outplayed, clawed back credibility and provided a platform of success for next season.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nArsenal have not qualified for the Champions League for the first time in 20 years - and many would believe an FA Cup triumph would be the perfect parting point, allowing Wenger to go out on a high and a successor to usher in the new era.\nWenger does not think in those terms. He is the eternal optimist who has never felt Arsenal were far away from recreating a title-winning team, even though the evidence against has piled up before him.\nHe is committed as ever, even after 1,175 games as Arsenal manager, 676 wins and a remarkable win percentage of 57.5% - but did Saturday start a new era of success that can emulate his early glories, or will he simply face the same criticism again at the first sign of trouble next season?\nThe Daily Mirror's chief football writer John Cross, author of \"Arsene Wenger: The Inside Story Of Arsenal Under Arsene Wenger\", first covered the club for Islington Gazette and has covered his reign through 20 years as a national reporter.\nHe told BBC Sport: \"I think it has gone a bit stale at times. I'd love to see Arsene Wenger go out on a high and, maybe now on the back of FA Cup glory and history, the time has come for him to go.\n\"The fans enjoyed their day at Wembley but is that the mood long term, or will they quickly go back to being unhappy? It's a fine line and Wenger should be remembered as nothing but a hero. Staying longer would put that in jeopardy.\"\nCross adds: \"He has been Arsenal's best ever manager. He's been fantastic, absolutely magnificent and an innovator for English football and Arsenal. But all good things come to an end and I just think, despite the FA Cup win, he's not the force he once was.\"\nArsenal season ticket holder and shareholder Darren Epstein, one of the most respected fan voices on Twitter with a following of 117,000, also believes there was a case for change.\nHe says: \"In my opinion we have reached a natural time when he should depart and the club should look to new ideas - but given that we have won a trophy, in that sense it has been a successful season to some extent.\"\nWenger's stubbornness has been his strength so often, but the French revolutionary who changed the face of British football when he arrived in 1996, has seemed reluctant to change himself faced with the new breed of managers arriving in the Premier League, such as Antonio Conte at Chelsea, Jurgen Klopp at Liverpool, Pep Guardiola at Manchester City, old adversary Jose Mourinho at Manchester United and Tottenham's Mauricio Pochettino.\nHe may, though, offer the counter argument that for all the praise and respect lavished on Klopp, Guardiola and Pochettino this season, Wenger has actually won more than any of them.\nIn his mind trophies are still a currency worth dealing in and will refresh his ambitions for the summer now he is staying.\nAnd while he picked up 69% of his trophy haul, 11 out of 16, from 1996/97 to 2005/06, his win percentage in that period has rarely dropped, reducing from 57.6% in that first phase to 57.5% in the subsequent period.\nIronically, Wenger and Arsenal's win percentage in all competitions this season, 63.6% from 55 matches, is actually higher than the 62.7% from 59 matches in \"The Invincibles\" campaign - an example of the vagaries of statistics.\nIndeed, this season he won an impressive 23 league games compared to 26 in 2003/04. The sign of the soft underbelly Wenger has failed to cure in recent years, and has made him the target for such criticism, is illustrated by nine defeats this season.\nWenger will now overtake Sir Alex Ferguson's record total of 810 games in charge, with his current total standing at 790.\nAnd it is a tribute to his longevity that his record of 20 years and seven months at Arsenal puts him 16 years ahead of the next Premier League manager's record at his current club, Eddie Howe's four years and seven months at Bournemouth.\nWenger is experienced enough to know that the undercurrent of unhappiness that has swirled around Emirates Stadium will not disappear with news he is staying. He will be aware many fans will not rejoice and a slow start next season could see the ill-feeling return.\nBut Martin Keown, a cornerstone of Wenger's glittering early period, when he won three titles and three FA Cups under the Frenchman, believes he will relish the fight.\nHe told BBC Sport: \"This guy is a fighter. He told me he was fighting every day in the playground at school. I hadn't met anyone else like that and I know I was. He is a scrapper and a survivor - more of a fighter and scrapper than people will ever think,\"\nThere is an element of further risk to his reputation by staying on. It remains to be seen whether it was risk worth taking.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nArsene Wenger insists Arsenal do not need major work on their squad, saying: \"We have to keep 90% of the squad together and bring in one or two more to strengthen the group - not too many but top quality.\"\nThe win against Chelsea and a run of seven wins out of Arsenal's last eight Premier League games suggests he is right - but the wider context of failure to reach the Champions League for the first time in two decades and a seventh successive exit at the last 16 stage of that tournament are the more significant statistics.\nWenger's argument cut no ice with former England striker Alan Shearer, who told BBC Sport after the FA Cup Final win: \"He said this week that he feels, with one or two signings, this Arsenal team is good enough to win the league - it's not.\n\"This Arsenal team is good enough to beat anyone on its day, as we saw at Wembley, but it's not good enough to win the league over a 38-game campaign.\n\"We saw that this season and they will have to strengthen considerably if they are going to change to become title contenders.\"\nWenger claimed Arsenal's season fell victim to a \"blip\" in March. It did contain desperate performances in 3-1 losses at Liverpool and West Bromwich Albion but a pattern of failure to challenge for the title for 13 years cannot simply be attributed to a \"blip.\"\nHow to cure this ailment must now be Wenger's top priority.\nHe must inject stronger physical and mental resolve into his side, a failing exemplified by the embarrassing 10-2 aggregate loss to Bayern Munich in the Champions League last 16 and the lame 3-0 loss at Crystal Palace in April.\nWenger must also rediscover his great alchemist's touch of the early days at Arsenal when he took the best of George Graham's legacy - and indeed Bruce Rioch's given that he bought Dennis Bergkamp - and sprinkled gold dust on The Gunners.\nHe brought in Patrick Vieira, Emmanuel Petit, Thierry Henry, Marc Overmars, Robert Pires and the teenage Nicolas Anelka - bought from Paris St. Germain for \u00a3500,000 in February 1997 as a 17-year-old and sold to Real Madrid in the summer of 1999 for \u00a322.3m - and Robin van Persie.\nIt displayed the touch of a master in the transfer market. As Keown says: \"He bought great players and made them greater.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nWenger's brilliance has appeared to desert him in recent times, with the list of stellar departures over the last decade such as Ashley Cole, Thierry Henry, Cesc Fabregas, Samir Nasir, Kolo Toure, Emmanuel Adebayor and Van Persie - who left Arsenal to win the title at Manchester United - not offset by a similar quality of arrivals.\nWenger was handicapped financially as Emirates Stadium was built but this is a trend which he and Arsenal's hierarchy, who have been able to use Wenger as a convenient shield from criticism, must change.\nHe has still brought in players of world repute such as Mesut Ozil from Real Madrid and Alexis Sanchez from Barcelona, but he must unearth the old habit of marrying that quality to uncovering the hidden gems that were once his trademark.\nKeown says: \"I think he's got good staff around him. I think the issue is the judgement of players, that's where now maybe there is a flaw coming in. He's judging these players as good enough and they haven't been.\n\"That can only stop with the manager and therefore he needs to get the right ingredients back into the club.\"\nJohn Cross says: \"They must buy better. He must change and evolve in terms of scouting and maybe the backroom staff needs a shake-up. I do think a bit of change can freshen things up even if the manager remains the same.\"\nKeown believes structural change is important, along with that improved transfer strategy, although Wenger has made his distaste and disdain for the appointment of a director of football obvious.\n\"We need to see a really ruthless summer now,\" says shareholder and fan Darren Epstein, \"with departures being replaced by far better arrivals.\n\"He needs to be ruthless. He is way too loyal and that has been to the huge detriment of the football club in my opinion.\n\"Big clubs don't wait that length of time to see if a player will end up being good enough.\"\nFormer Arsenal keeper Jens Lehmann, a member of \"The Invincibles\", believes Wenger can make the necessary changes, telling BBC Sport: \"Of course there is criticism but on the other hand everybody who knows Arsene is aware he has got the intelligence and creativity to turn it right again.\n\"He has to make changes but if he can do that he can go on for another one or two years.\"\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nWenger must solve contract issues for Ozil and Sanchez, who both have a year left on current deals, swiftly to stop the scenery shifting to another debate backstage.\nHe has a good chance of keeping the German because of a lack of serious alternatives but Bayern Munich are among a clutch of clubs linked with the Chilean.\nSanchez may be high maintenance and prone to public petulance, but he has almost become priceless to Arsenal.\nThe unrest off the field has been mirrored by discontent aimed at the boardroom, with supporters chanting for owner Kroenke to leave the club during and after the final game of the season against Everton, days after it was revealed he had rejected a \u00a31.3bn takeover bid from Alisher Usmanov, who has a 30% stake in the club.\nKroenke has always been a staunch Wenger supporter but is seen by many fans as too much of a benign, distant presence.\nEpstein adds: \"The club position is harder to tell - a non-intervening owner in Stan Kroenke, a chief executive officer in Ivan Gazidis who seems to want to implement change but Arsene is against it, a schism within the fanbase. It's hard to see how that is repaired unless we become truly competitive.\"\nKeown also hints that Arsenal must now adopt a tougher mindset and aim higher to end the years of being marginalised in the chase for the elusive Premier League prize.\nHe told the BBC: \"The mediocrity that has been created by accepting fourth place is good enough has created a problem for this current group.\n\"When the manager and the club come out and say they are happy with fourth, well I don't know what happened there because they certainly weren't happy with that when I was there.\"\nAnd this is the pattern Wenger, having re-committed to Arsenal, must quickly change.\nWenger's stock is currently high - even those who have marched against him and brandished banners such as \"Thanks For The Memories But It's Time To Say Goodbye\", \"Wexit\" and \"Every Good Story Has An Ending\" must give him huge praise for the Wembley victory.\nThe question is how long it will be before the reservoir of goodwill starts to run dry once more should Wenger and his team fail to challenge for title next season.\nJohn Cross says decision on Wenger will not be a cause for unanimous celebration.\n\"I don't think the fans will be impressed\", says Cross\n\"I think it's time for change. It's been more pessimistic than optimistic for large parts of the season. But no-one should forget the glory and celebrations from the FA Cup final. That should be the abiding memory of the season and of Wenger.\"\nIf Wenger is rejuvenated by Saturday's success and his third FA Cup win in four years - a highly impressive record - there is now the chance of a summer to rebuild optimism.\n\"My, and many other fans', optimism stems from what the club usually does in the summer\" adds Epstein. \"The summer we bought Petr Cech from Chelsea and nobody else has led us to where we are this season in my opinion and did huge harm to the team's ability to compete.\n\"I would hope they know this summer they need to add quality in two or three players.\"\nAnd with the debate around his future finally resolved, Arsene Wenger can start to write fresh chapters in his Arsenal story.",

They form a wobbly line and march up and down on the spot.\nInside another group of kids are learning how to handle weapons - firing blanks down an empty hall way to improve their aim.\nThis after-school club is ostensibly part of a drugs prevention programme: a programme of evening activities with a patriotic military slant, aimed at keeping local kids away from drinking and shooting up.\nBut for the club's organiser, Stepan Zotov, it is much more than that.\nIt is an invisible army getting ready to defend the Fatherland.\n\"This rise in patriotic feeling during the last years must have had a foundation. And we are this foundation,\" he explains with a gleam in his eye.\n\"For the last 10 years, clubs like ours have worked tirelessly, fanatically I could say, to raise a generation of young people who believe in the mission and idea of Great Russia.\"\nMr Zotov's English is near perfect - polished at international conventions of the table top fantasy war game, War Hammer, through interaction with other fans.\nHe exacts demanding standards from his young charges.\nWhat is being instilled in them is not just patriotism, but self-discipline and obedience.\n\"Russia is a military power. Our state is in a state of constant readiness to repel aggression.\n\"To be a warrior in Russia is not just a profession, it is a sacred calling. It is actually sacred, holy.\"\nThe teenagers are lapping it up.\nOne boy, 14-year-old Alexander, wants to go into the army.\nA girl, 16-year-old Anna, would like to join the Russian border guards or the intelligence service, the FSB.\nAnd now there is an actual war to fight in - the conflict in Eastern Ukraine, or Novorossiya as these patriots call it.\nStepan does not hide the fact that he and some of his cadets have been there to fight.\n\"We couldn't be regulars there, but for a week or a month or two, as much as we can give. This is all part of a great territory which has been part of Russia for many centuries.\n\"Part of our nation and our cultural space and we must protect them.\"\nNot surprisingly Mr Zotov would like to see these eastern Ukrainian regions become part of Russia.\nThe vision is part Russian nationalist, and part Soviet: a return to the state of affairs before the USSR collapsed in 1991, when Russia and the territories around it were one country.\nA curious hybrid of nostalgia for the Soviet era  - multicultural and secular - and a more nationalistic religious adherence to what are described as Russian Orthodox ideas and spiritual values.\nEither way, it is a vision of Russia as a country with a unique destiny, perpetually under threat from abroad, alone and misunderstood.\nIn a warehouse in another Moscow suburb, a woman called Elena and a man called Andrei are busy sealing up boxes of aid for the suffering civilians of Donetsk and Luhansk in Eastern Ukraine.\nA monastery has donated bags of maize and buckwheat, dry macaroni, sugar and dried milk.\nThere are huge sacks of second-hand clothes and shoes donated by well-wishers too.\nAndrei is coy about his background but indicates that he is a former FSB intelligence officer who has also served in Eastern Ukraine.\n\"I was in the Ghost battalion with the rebels, but I didn't fight. I was engaged in information questions,\" he says.\nHe reveals he also served in the last war in Chechnya and took part in the operation last year to take Crimea.\nHe is dismissive of the current ceasefire in Ukraine, but won't be drawn on what he thinks should happen to Eastern Ukraine.\n\"The decision about where Novorossiya should go - Ukraine or Russia - should be taken by the people there,\" he says.\nHe plays down the idea that the current crisis will lead to a war with the West.\nBut it is clear that for these Russian patriots, the Ukraine conflict is only a symptom of a much deeper confrontation, where Russia's real opponent is and always has been Europe and the West.\n\"Whoever tried to wage war against us, France, Germany, the Polish and everyone else - there were never any friends, only interests - a desire to destroy Russia and make her a donor of natural resources for other states,\" says Andrei.\nBack at the after-school patriotic club, Stepan Zotov puts it more bluntly.\nIn his view, even the alliance against Hitler in World War Two was only a temporary arrangement, born out of mutual defence interests. Russia and the West were never on the same side.\n\"We understand very sharply the great and undeniable gap between Russian culture and Western culture,\" he says.\n\"For 60-70 years, there has been no fundamental change. Then or now, you are our enemy. And we have no illusions about this state ever changing. You are a different civilisation.\"\nWhat is curious is that he manages to make this sound both chilling and somehow amicable at the same time, as though the aggressive ultra-nationalistic rhetoric against foreign enemies is on one level, and day to day dealings with individual foreigners is on another level altogether.\nBut when it comes to what these patriots call \"national traitors\"- Russia's enemies from within - the benevolence disappears.\nBehind a tall fence on the edge of Moscow lies the territory of Russia's most famous bike club, the Night Wolves.\nIt looks like a cross between a medieval fortress and film set for Mad Max movie or Kevin Costner's Waterworld.\nCarcasses of old motorbikes have been crafted into gothic sculptures.\nThe main entrance is flanked by two stuffed snarling wolves.\nIn the workshop a scary looking biker with a shaved tattooed head who goes under the name of  Bulldog shows off the show bikes, on the orders of his chief.\nAlexander Zaldostanov, known as The Surgeon, is a long-time Russian nationalist.\nHis club enjoys President Vladimir Putin's patronage.\nHe is on the Western sanctions list. And he was one of the instigators of the so-called 'Anti Maidan movement in Moscow, set up to stop a Kiev-style uprising from happening in Russia.\nIts big rally in Moscow in February included banners vilifying both the West and Russian opposition figures, and came just days before the assassination of opposition politician, Boris Nemtsov.\nInterviewed at his headquarters, Mr Zaldostanov blamed the Nemtsov murder on provocateurs, but was in no doubt that the biggest danger facing Russia at the moment was the so-called Fifth Column of national traitors.\n\"This issue is very important. Is it one of my duties - to resist the actions of the Fifth Column - that is those people who work for other governments and not for their homeland and for other people's money,\" he says.\n\"It has happened to us before, an entire army composed of traitors fighting against their own people. It is a terrible enemy, the number one enemy facing Russia.\"\nMr Zaldostanov was quick to add that the way to combat this 'internal enemy' should not be through violent means.\nBut a national campaign against the Fifth Column in Russia has already been espoused by Mr Putin and enshrined in a new law against so-called Foreign Agents - non-governmental organisations, especially those engaged with political or human rights work, who have links or funding from abroad.\nSipping tea in her antique-filled apartment, Elena Nemirovskaya does not look like a threat to anyone.\nBut her legendary School of Civic Education was recently added to the Ministry of Justice blacklist of Foreign Agents, so she and her husband have decided to close it.\nFor more than 20 years she brought European political experts to Moscow to educate young Russians from all over the country in the importance of the rule of law and democracy. But not any more.\n\"We are not continuing this school because they have humiliated us. How can we come to Russian regions and work with people?\" says Mrs Nemirovskaya.\n\"Foreign Agents in Russian means foreign spy. We cannot agree with this title. We are not.\"\nNonetheless she is not entirely giving up. She still runs e-seminars via Skype for those interested enough to phone in.\n\"One day civic society will be strong again,\" she says. \"It may take a long time, but we have so much more work to do.\"\nGolos is another Russian non-governmental organisation, a nationwide election monitoring network, which has found itself on the Ministry of Justice blacklist.\nIronically it had voluntarily cut foreign funding to protect itself, but fell foul of the new law when it was sent prize money for an international human rights award.\nRoman Udot, who runs the Moscow office, explains that they fought back by changing their status from 'association' (a legal entity in Russia) to 'movement', in other words a group of individuals with no legal status.\nThen they used the publicity from the court case to ask supporters online for funds to pay off the fine of 400,000 roubles.\nThe crowdsourcing appeal worked. Before long they had collected 1.8 million roubles - an interesting insight into the extent of quiet support for oppositional activity which still exists below the radar in Russia.\nMr Udot says their new unofficial status has restricted their access to polling stations, though they still manage to do some monitoring with the help of sympathetic election observers and journalists.\nBut he is worried about the future.\nAlready the head of one Golos branch in the lower Volga region has been targeted as an individual, facing multiple charges of acting as a 'foreign agent', tax evasion and criminal activity.\nSo what does the future hold?\nAlongside his anxieties about how his civic activism will survive, Roman Udot is not down-hearted.\nHe even wonders if the apparent strength of the Putin government conceals a lack of resilience, and actually the current state of affairs might change unexpectedly fast, as it did in 1991.\n\"Will Putin be in power for a long time? Nobody knows, but this is Russia,\" says Mr Udot.\n\"Remember the attempted coup (by hard line communists) in 1991? Those of us who were resisting, we were expecting to be killed right under the walls of the White House. But we won! In just three days!\n\"The Soviet system had tortured people for 70 years, but in three days it was over, almost without a shot. So nobody knows.\"\nBut this scenario is dismissed as fantasy by Russia's patriots.\nThey believe they are in the ascendancy and that the current crisis in relations with the West has only advanced their cause.\nThey are convinced that many people in Russia support them and they have the backing of the Kremlin.\n\"There is no opposition actually,\" says Stepan Zotov.\n\"It just exists to create an illusion maybe for Western countries that we have some kind of opposition.\n\"Putin might have his mistakes but obviously he is the best option,\" he adds.\n\"There is no-one else. He is the best hope for a united future, for the resurrection of Russian destiny.\"",

    "text": "Since then, it has become what US officials have described as \"the most active operational franchise\" of al-Qaeda beyond Pakistan and Afghanistan.\nThe group has vowed to target oil facilities, foreigners and security forces as it seeks to topple the Saudi and Yemeni governments, and establish an Islamic caliphate.\nIt has claimed responsibility for a large number of attacks in the two countries, in which hundreds of people have been killed, as well as a series of sophisticated airline bomb plots targeting the US that were narrowly foiled.\nAQAP has also capitalised on the instability in Yemen in recent years to establish strongholds in the country's south and east, sometimes taking control of entire towns and villages.\nBut the group has also suffered setbacks, mostly as a result of a US drone campaign that has seen more than 100 air strikes targeting its operatives in the past six years.\nIn June 2015, AQAP announced that its leader Nasser al-Wuhayshi - who was believed to also have been al-Qaeda's overall second-in-command - had been killed in an air raid.\nWhile the group was quick to replace Wuhayshi with the experienced military and operations chief, Qasim al-Raymi, analysts said his death was a significant blow.\nFollowing the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, the late al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden sought to launch a campaign in his homeland of Saudi Arabia with the intention of driving Americans out of the country and toppling the \"apostate\" monarchy.\nIn May 2003, a local offshoot claimed responsibility for simultaneous suicide bombing attacks on three Western housing compounds in Riyadh, which left 29 people dead.\nDespite a subsequent crackdown on Islamist militants and radicals by the Saudi security forces, al-Qaeda in Saudi Arabia was able to mount an attack on the Muhayyah residential compound in the capital that November, killing 17 people.\nIn 2004, it suffered a major blow when its leader, Khaled Ali Hajj - a Yemeni and former bodyguard of Bin Laden - was ambushed and killed by Saudi troops.\nHowever, the group soon recovered under the guidance of a veteran Saudi militant, Abdul Aziz al-Muqrin, and launched a series of spectacular attacks.\nOn 1 May 2004, militants shot dead five Western workers at a petrochemical complex in the north-western Red Sea city of Yanbu. On 29 May, more than 20 foreign and Saudi nationals were killed in attacks on three sites in the city of al-Khobar, increasing fears of political instability and pushing up global oil prices.\nThe following month, members of AQAP abducted and beheaded a 49-year old American aerospace worker named Paul Johnson.\nThe triumph was short-lived, however, as when security forces stormed a hideout in Riyadh looking for Johnson's murderers Muqrin was shot dead.\nAlthough militants killed at least nine people in a raid on the US consulate in Jeddah in December 2004, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula enjoyed notably less success under Muqrin's successor, Salih al-Awfi.\nThe Saudi security services gradually gained the upper hand, and succeed in preventing any major attacks the following year, when Awfi was himself killed during a police raid in the holy city of Medina.\nIn spite of the large numbers of Saudis who then travelled to militant training camps and gained experience fighting in places such as Iraq, the group found it increasingly difficult to organise operational cells inside the kingdom. Its last attempt a significant attack was at the Abqaiq oil facility in February 2006.\nMeanwhile in Yemen - the ancestral home of Bin Laden - militants took advantage of the weak central government, whose authority does not extend far outside the capital Sanaa, and established strongholds in its largely autonomous tribal regions.\nAlthough al-Qaeda cells were held responsible for several attacks inside Yemen since the suicide boat attack on the USS Cole near the port of Aden in 2000 that killed 17 US sailors, it was not until the second half of the decade that a fully-functioning affiliated group was formed.\nAccording to analyst Gregory Johnsen, between 2002 and 2003 the Yemeni government co-operated closely with the US to fight al-Qaeda. By the end of that period - which included one leader being killed in a controversial strike by a CIA drone aircraft - al-Qaeda appeared to be substantially weakened and so both countries shifted focus.\nThe policy appeared to have worked until February 2006, Mr Johnsen says, when 23 suspected al-Qaeda members managed to escape from a prison in Sanaa, including Jamal al-Badawi, the alleged mastermind of the USS Cole bombing.\nMost were eventually either recaptured or killed, but two of the lesser-known escapees eluded the authorities, including Nasser Abdul Karim al-Wuhayshi, a former personal assistant to Bin Laden in Afghanistan, and Qasim al-Raymi.\nBorn in 1976 in the Mukayras region of what is now the southern province of al-Bayda, Wuhayshi spent time in religious institutions in Yemen before travelling to Afghanistan in 1998 and joining al-Qaeda. He fought at the battle of Tora Bora in December 2001, before escaping over the border into Iran, where he was eventually arrested. He was extradited to Yemen in 2003.\nRaymi, born in Sanaa in 1978, was as a trainer at an al-Qaeda camp in Afghanistan in the 1990s before returning to Yemen. In 2004, he was imprisoned for five years in connection with a plot to attack five foreign embassies in the capital.\nAfter escaping from prison, Wuhayshi and Raymi are said to have overseen the formation of al-Qaeda in Yemen, which took in both new recruits and experienced Arab fighters returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. Protected by tribes who were wary of government interference, the group established bases from which to launch fresh attacks.\nThe group claimed responsibility for two suicide bomb attacks that killed six Western tourists before being linked to the assault on the US embassy in Sanaa in September 2008, in which militants detonated bombs and fired rocket-propelled grenades. Ten Yemeni guards and four civilians were killed, along with six assailants.\nFour months later, Wuhayshi announced in a video the merger of the al-Qaeda offshoots in Yemen and Saudi Arabia to form \"al-Qaeda of Jihad Organisation in the Arabian Peninsula\".\nAnalysts said the move was designed to bring Saudi al-Qaeda members who had fled their country and Yemeni militants together under one umbrella as a first step towards launching attacks throughout the region.\nNext to Wuhayshi and Raymi, the group's military commander, in the same video sat the new deputy leader, Said Ali al-Shihri, a Saudi national who was released from the US military detention centre at Guantanamo Bay in November 2007.\nAnother former detainee, Mohammed Atiq al-Harbi, also known as Mohammed al-Awfi, appeared alongside them and was described as a field commander.\nEmbarrassingly for both Riyadh and Washington, both men had been released from Guantanamo into the custody of the Saudi government's \"deradicalisation\" programme for militants, which included art therapy. They both left the facility within weeks.\nThe group's first operation outside Yemen was carried out in Saudi Arabia in August 2009 against the kingdom's security chief, Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, though he survived. The bomber, Ahmed al-Asiri, concealed a device containing the high-explosive pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) inside his body.\nHis brother, Ibrahim, is believed to have made the bomb, as well as the device used in the failed attempt to destroy a Northwest Airlines Airbus A330 as it flew into Detroit on Christmas Day 2011.\nA Nigerian man sentenced to life in prison in connection with the incident, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, allegedly told investigators that AQAP operatives trained him in Yemen, equipped him with a powerful explosive device and told him what to do.\nAfter news of the latter incident emerged, AQAP released a statement saying it had sought to avenge raids by Yemeni forces aided by US intelligence, in which dozens of militants are reported to have died.\nFollowing the bombing attempt, Yemeni government forces launched a major offensive against AQAP, targeting the organisation's senior leaders and training camps in the governorates of Shabwa, Abyan and Marib.\nThey were supported heavily by the US, which sent advisers, provided intelligence, deployed unmanned drones and fired cruise missiles.\nThough officials claimed six leaders were killed, the offensive was considered largely unsuccessful. Instead of decapitating AQAP and disrupting its operations, the group shifted its strategy and stepped up its attacks inside Yemen.\nIn February 2010, Raymi issued a statement threatening the US.\n\"Today, you have attacked us in the middle of our household, so wait for what will befall you in the middle of yours,\" he said. \"We will blow up the earth from beneath your feet\".\nEight months later, the group was accused of sending bombs hidden in two packages addressed to synagogues in the US city of Chicago, which were found on planes in Dubai and the UK.\nBoth were shipped from Yemen and used PETN, the explosive that was also used in the two earlier attacks on Prince Mohammed and the Northwest Airlines jet. One of the detonators was also almost exactly the same as the one used by Mr Abdulmutallab. US officials said Ibrahim al-Asiri had made them.\nAt home, AQAP capitalised on political turmoil in Yemen resulting from the uprising against longtime President Ali Abdullah Saleh in 2011 to capture a string of southern towns and villages, only to be driven out of many areas in an army offensive in 2012 ordered by Mr Saleh's successor, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi.\nAt the same time, US President Barack Obama authorised a three-fold increase in the number of drone strikes targeting AQAP operatives in Yemen in 2012, resulting in the deaths of a number of senior figures, including Shihri, the deputy leader.\nThe territorial losses did not, however, stop AQAP from launching major attacks Yemeni security forces and government personnel.\nThey included a suicide bombing at a military parade in Sanaa in May 2012 that killed more than 120 people, and a raid on a hospital in the defence ministry compound in the capital in December 2013 that left 56 people dead.\nAt the same time, Wuhayshi was reportedly named al-Qaeda's \"general manager\" by Bin Laden's successor as overall leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri. Intercepted communications between the two men led to an alert that saw several US embassies closed in the Middle East and Africa in August 2013.\nIn March 2014, Wuhayshi was filmed telling a outdoor gathering of dozens of militants that al-Qaeda would fight Western \"Crusaders\" and their allies everywhere, pledging to \"remove the cross, the bearer of the cross, America\".\nThat December, the group threatened to kill an American journalist it was holding hostage, Luke Somers, if its unspecified demands were not met within three days. As the deadline approached, Somers was killed along with another hostage, South African teacher Pierre Korkie, during a failed rescue attempt by US special forces.\nIn January 2015, AQAP claimed to be behind a deadly attack on the Paris offices of the French satirical magazine, Charlie Hebdo, which had published caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad. Officials confirmed that one of the gunmen had received training at an AQAP camp.\nAQAP also refused to pledge allegiance to the leader of the rival jihadist group, Islamic State, after it proclaimed the creation of caliphate in the territory under its control in Syria and Iraq, bucking the trend among other al-Qaeda affiliates.\nIn Yemen, AQAP capitalised on the chaos caused by a rebellion by the Houthi movement and a Saudi-led air campaign to weaken the Zaidi Shia group, expanding the territory it controlled in the south and east of the country.\nHowever, the US drone strikes targeting AQAP did not stop and one was reported to have killed Wuhayshi as he met two fellow militants in Mukalla on 9 June.\nOn 16 June, AQAP official Khaled Batarfi confirmed Wuhayshi's death in a video statement and vowed that \"the blood of these pioneers makes us more determined to sacrifice\". Batarfi also said Raymi had been elected by the group's leadership council to succeed Wuhayshi.",

personally.\n\"I have been fortunate that an awful lot has happened in my favour in recent years with the Northern Ireland Executive recognising the importance of Rathlin and the work of a lot of people on the island.\"\n\"Hopefully it might open a few ears to me,\"  he added.\nColm Davis, the principal of Tor Bank School in Castlereagh, County Down, has been appointed an OBE for services to children with special educational needs.\nHe said: \"I am absolutely stunned, humbled, delighted and over the moon.\n\"The last five weeks trying to keep it a secret have been difficult.\n\"But all of it wouldn't have been possible without the school, the kids, the staff and the parents, they've been wonderful and very supportive.\n\"Fighting for those most vulnerable kids in society, those with severe and complex needs, you want the best for them and that's made my life and my commitment to my work worthwhile,\" he added.\nThe Lisburn-based businessman John Cunningham has been awarded a CBE.\nIn 2008, he sold most of his business, Kelman, to GE, the global industrial firm.\nHe kept one division, which he has built into the Camlin Group.\nIt designs and manufactures electronic equipment for the power and rail industries.\nMr Cunningham has been involved in campaigning for corporation tax devolution to Northern Ireland.\nOther business figures to be given honours include Norman Lynas who receives an OBE.\nHe is the founder and chairman of Coleraine-based Lynas Foodservice.\nJJ Donnelly who built the SDC Trailers business in Toomebridge is awarded an MBE.\nLast year

    "text": "Chelsea and Terry announced the mutual decision in low-key fashion after a campaign in which the 36-year-old club captain has been reduced to the ranks, barely figuring as manager Antonio Conte has led them to the top of the Premier League table.\nTerry may have been marginalised by injuries, advancing years and the progress of others in the new Chelsea age - but he still stands as the symbol of the years of success stretching back to the appointment of Jose Mourinho in 2004 and the club's first title in 50 years, claimed in the manager's first season.\nSo, as Barking-born Terry prepares to say farewell to his beloved Stamford Bridge, how will a player and personality who has polarised opinion be remembered?\nThe banner that is still draped from Stamford Bridge's Matthew Harding Stand finds few dissenters among Chelsea's fans as it is emblazoned with the message: \"JT. Captain. Leader. Legend.\"\nThose words are now part of Chelsea's vocabulary and were referenced in the club statement announcing his departure. They were a tribute throughout Terry's career and will be his epitaph when he has left.\nTerry may have been a divisive figure outside Stamford Bridge but inside he is regarded as the warrior who led Chelsea into battle, one of the most significant figures in the club's history and a towering player who can take his place among the greats.\nWhen Roman Abramovich arrived at Chelsea to change the face of the Premier League in 2003, it was Terry who remained firmly at the helm as a succession of managers - many hugely successful such as Mourinho and the double-winning Carlo Ancelotti - came and went. And in Mourinho's case went, came back and then went again.\nThe statistics - whether he found favour or not - are testament to his talent and undisputed evidence of what he has meant to Chelsea.\nTerry has made 713 appearances for Chelsea since his debut as a late substitute in a League Cup tie with Aston Villa on 28 October 1998. He is third in the all-time appearance list behind Ron Harris and Peter Bonetti, scoring 66 goals and captaining Chelsea a record 578 times.\nHe has had a silver-lined career which included four Premier League titles, five FA Cups and three League Cups - including that domestic \"Double\" under Ancelotti in 2010.\nTerry was also gifted the Champions League and Europe League in the roll of honour delivered with his abdication statement although he never played against Bayern Munich in the Champions League final in 2012 and against Benfica in the Europa League final a year later, events which encompass the darker side of his career.\nTerry is worshipped by supporters who regard him as their representative on the pitch. He is man who plays as they would given the chance - and the fact that he was among the most outstanding central defenders of his generation only added to his lustre.\nHe was the manager's voice on the pitch and had a sure touch with fans off it, often rounding off his captain's programme notes with the rallying cry: \"Come On The Chels!\"\nTerry was the great organiser, leader and talisman as Chelsea battled for domestic supremacy with Manchester United and Arsenal and European glory alongside the superpowers at home and abroad.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device\nThis has been a low-profile farewell campaign, with Terry barely seen after an early-season injury and a shift in tactical emphasis from manager Conte to employing a three-man defensive system of David Luiz, Gary Cahill and Cesar Azpilicueta, flanked by Victor Moses and Marcos Alonso.\nTerry has only played five league games, with four starts, three FA Cup games and two EFL Cup games this season, last starting in the FA Cup at Wolves on 18 February - a grand total of 718 minutes.\nWhether he gets the chance of a grand farewell will depend on Chelsea's fortunes between now and the end of the season as they protect a slender four-point gap from Tottenham at the top of the Premier League table.\nIf the finale goes to Chelsea's plan, then the last game of the season, at home to Sunderland on Sunday, 21 May, is likely to be an occasion high on emotion.\nIt is certainly a cleaner, more dignified break than it threatened to be when he announced in January 2016 after an FA Cup fourth-round win at MK Dons that he had not been offered a new deal and it was \"not going to be a fairytale ending\" - an announcement which appeared to come as a surprise to Chelsea.\nFences were mended, a new one-year contract agreed, and while this may not be a fairytale, it is a parting that is amicable, mutual and leaves the door wide open for Terry's return to Stamford Bridge.\nThose outside the club often used words other than \"Captain. Leader. Legend\" to describe Terry but even those who never warmed to him would surely admit to a grudging respect for his ability, success, drive and longevity.\nThe words of his contemporaries provide the biggest tribute with Jamie Carragher - on opposing sides to Terry in numerous battles against Liverpool - calling him \"the best centre-back we've seen in the Premier League era\".\nEven as Terry sat on the bench during Chelsea's 2-0 loss to Manchester United on Sunday, Old Trafford was reminding him in colourful terms of arguably the lowest moment of a career that was a story of contrasts.\nFor all the glory, there was a thread of disappointment and controversy running throughout his time with Chelsea and England that led to him being a personality who split opinion.\nUnited's fans were gleefully recalling the moment that reduced Terry to tears after the Champions League loss on penalties to Sir Alex Ferguson's side in May 2008, when he stepped forward in the Moscow downpour to take what would have been the winning spot-kick, only to slip and hit the post in a moment that will haunt him forever as Chelsea went on to lose.\nTerry was even denied redemption when Chelsea finally claimed their holy grail by beating Bayern Munich in their own Allianz Arena four years later under interim manager Roberto di Matteo. Terry missed the final through suspension after he was sent off in the semi-final second leg in Barcelona. He put his kit on for the celebratory photographs but was not part of the winning team and gave the impression of someone with his nose pressed up against the window looking in on the glory.\nAnd when Chelsea beat Benfica in Amsterdam to win the 2013 Europa League, Terry was out injured. This trophy was won under another interim manager, Rafael Benitez, who had a fractious relationship with his captain.\nHe was also in the headlines off the field during his Chelsea career, most notably in September 2012 when he was banned for four games and fined \u00a3220,000 after a Football Association regulatory commission found him guilty of racially abusing then Queens Park Rangers defender Anton Ferdinand during a game at Loftus Road on 23 October 2011.\nIt was an incident that had an impact on Terry's England career, which he ended with a self-imposed retirement after 78 caps. He had been cleared of abusing Ferdinand at Westminster Magistrates Court in July and felt the FA's decision to pursue a disciplinary hearing made his position \"untenable\".\nTerry had been stripped of the captaincy by the FA over the matter in the previous February, a decision which was the catalyst for the resignation of England manager Fabio Capello, who was critical of the move.\nThe Italian was a staunch admirer of Terry, even restoring him to the England captaincy 13 months after removing him from the role in February 2010 after allegations the defender had a relationship with the ex-girlfriend of former England and Chelsea team-mate Wayne Bridge - an allegation Terry denied.\nThere are gaps in the CV. There are controversies that will always be linked to his name. What is beyond dispute is his status as Chelsea's greatest and most successful captain.\nTerry's departure breaks the last link in the chain of Chelsea's great generation, the last member of the spine of the teams that brought the club such success since the Millennium.\nHe was the last of the big beasts from a Chelsea's dressing room almost over-crowded with huge characters, one which occasionally had to answer to accusations it wielded too much power, especially when managers such as Andre Villas-Boas and even the all-conquering Mourinho were sacked, twice in the latter's case.\nTerry was a pivotal figure surrounded by the likes of goalkeeper Petr Cech, full-back Ashley Cole, England colleague Frank Lampard and the great striker Didier Drogba, all Stamford Bridge giants.\nIt is now time for Chelsea's new breed to take the club forward without the player and personality who has been a pillar of their success.\nClubs around the globe will have been alerted by Terry's declaration that he intends to continue his playing career.\nIt is hard, rather like Steven Gerrard and Jamie Carragher at Liverpool, to see Terry pulling on the shirt of a Premier League club other than Chelsea - but Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe has been interested in him before and may try again.\nWest Bromwich Albion manager Tony Pulis is another who will have noted Terry's decision with interest, although it remains to be seen whether the interest is reciprocated.\nThere are the more obvious potential destinations for Terry such as Major League Soccer in the United States, which was a stop-off before retirement for former Chelsea and England team-mate Lampard at New York City FC and Gerrard at LA Galaxy - where another ex-colleague Ashley Cole currently plays.\nDoes Terry, however, have the current status to make him attractive to an MLS team at his age and with barely a game to his name in 12 months?\nChina is an obvious and lucrative option. Terry has been linked with a move to Guangzhou Evergrande Taobao, who are coached by former Chelsea manager Luiz Felipe Scolari.\nChelsea to China is already a well-worn route with Ramires at Jiangsu Suning, Oscar at Shanghai SIPG and Jon Obi Mikel at Tianjin TEDA.\nAn opportunity in Qatar may also be offered - and Terry is unlikely to be short of options for his final move.",

    "text": "But beneath the surface, Westminster life seethes with intrigue.\nOn the government side, the position of the prime minister and the ambitions of would-be successors are the subject of endless speculation, which means that all kinds of occasions can morph into opportunities for possible contenders to, ever so subtly, strut their stuff.\nWith the elections for select committee chairs due on Wednesday, there are plenty of MPs pursuing influential perches on the committee corridor.\nThe biggest prize is probably the chair of the Treasury Committee - vacated by Andrew Tyrie, who stood down at the last election; but the chairs of the Education and Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committees are also open.\nAnd, as some old-stagers shake their heads, two incumbent chairs, Julian Lewis in Defence, and Crispin Blunt in Foreign Affairs, are being challenged.\nLong-serving Foreign Affairs Committee member John Baron is seeking the chair of that committee, as is Tom Tugendhat from the 2015 intake. Another new-ish MP, Johnny Mercer is seeking the chair of Defence - will the torch be seized by a younger generation?\nThe key to understanding these races is that, where several MPs from one party are contesting a post, the winner is the one with the most appeal to the other parties - so Labour MPs, in effect, will pick the winner in hotly contested elections like the one for the Treasury Committee chair.\nElsewhere the All-Party Parliamentary Groups are springing into action...Margaret Hodge's APPG on tax, which is zeroing-in on a particularly sensitive political issue, is taking shape, and the APPG on cancer is launching its second inquiry into NHS England's Cancer Strategy, which will feed into a 'Britain Against Cancer' conference in Westminster on 5 December.\nHere's my rundown of the week ahead:\nThe Commons week begins (2.30pm) with Defence Questions - providing a final chance for the contenders for the post of Defence Committee chair, the incumbent, Julian Lewis, and his challenger, Johnny Mercer, with a final audition for the job.\nThe day's legislating is on the second reading of the Telecommunications Infrastructure (Relief from Non-Domestic Rates) Bill - which scraps business rates on new ultrafast broadband lines as part of the government's drive to speed up Britain's move to ultrafast broadband and 5G mobile coverage.\nOlder telecoms infrastructure will still be taxed as the government seeks to encourage a switch to \"gold standard\" fibre optics rather than upgrades to get better performance from old-style copper telephone lines.\nIn the Lords (2.30 pm) questions to ministers include one on setting up a Data Ethics Commission from the former CEO of TalkTalk, the Conservative, Baroness Harding of Winscombe. The day's main debate is on the current security situation in the UK - with 20 peers listed to speak at the time of writing.\nThe Commons meets at 11.30am for Foreign Office Questions (watch out for a bit of competition between Messrs Blunt, Baron and Tugendhat) with any statements or urgent questions following at 12.30pm.\nSlightly to everyone's surprise, the Commons will then deal with the detail of the Air Travel Organisers' Licensing Bill - given its second reading this week -  in a committee of the whole House, with report stage and third reading following immediately after.\nThere has already been some Opposition chuntering that the government should have set up a bill committee, and some speculation about why they have not. Some accuse ministers of trying to bog down the House in legislative chores and general debates, because they dare not put controversial legislation before MPs. Expect these complaints to intensify, if this continues.\nOne piece of controversial legislation is expected to appear - but only to be presented, not debated. The Great Repeal Bill, as it will not be called, because Commons rules prohibit argumentative titles for legislation, will be formally published this week - with rumour pointing for Tuesday as the day for the formalities to be enacted. The actual second reading debate will not be until September, at the earliest.\nThe adjournment debate, led by the Conservative, Sir Paul Beresford, is on Section 136 of the Mental Health Act 1983 - an emergency power which allows the police to remove an apparently mentally disordered person from a public place to a place of safety, for up to 72 hours.\nIn Westminster Hall, the former Conservative chief whip Mark Harper - now on the backbenches - leads a debate (9.30am-11am) on balancing the public finances. There has been a lot of internal criticism that the Conservatives have failed to make the intellectual case for austerity, in the face of Jeremy Corbyn's attacks on spending cuts.\nThe newly elected Lib Dem Layla Moran discusses the role of children's centres in tackling social inequality (11am-11.30 am) and in the afternoon, Labour's Lucy Powell has a longer debate (2.30pm- 4pm) on government policies on social mobility - her aim is to give MPs a chance to debate the recent Social Mobility Commission report, Time for change: an assessment of government policies on social mobility 1997-2017, with ministers.\nShe has been carving out a niche as a social mobility campaigner since she left the Labour frontbench, and will use the debate to renew her calls (made with Nicky Morgan and Nick Clegg in the last Parliament) for more cross-party joint working on what works for social mobility.  With the sensitive subject of grammar schools likely to feature, it may also see a bit of last-minute campaigning from candidates for the chair of the Education Committee.\nThe SNP's Dr Lisa Cameron has a debate (4.30pm-5.30pm) on consultation with disabled people on the effect on their services of the UK leaving the EU.\nIn the Lords (2.30pm) the usual half hour of questions to ministers is followed by an order to extend non-jury trials in Northern Ireland.\nThen peers will turn to the second reading of the Armed Forces (Flexible Working) Bill - which would allow for part time and flexible working arrangements for armed forces personnel: the idea is that the conditions of service must offer recruits a career that better reflects the realities of modern life - it is hoped that allowing greater flexibility over how long and where people work will help attract and keep the talent the forces need.\nThere will also be a short debate on the diplomatic crisis in the Gulf region and the steps being taken to de-escalate tensions and encourage Qatar to engage with its neighbours about their concerns about extremism.\nThe Commons begins (11.30am) with International Development Questions, followed at noon by Prime Minister's Questions.\nThese occasions may not have much cut-through with the public most of the time, but are increasingly critical for Conservative Party morale.\nThe rest of the day is devoted to a debate on the Grenfell Tower fire inquiry. One strand of this is the increasing pressure from senior MPs for some kind of parliamentary role in drawing up the terms of reference of major inquiries, and appointing the chair.\nThe PM is the 'sponsoring minister' for the inquiry and as a result the department handling arrangements is the Cabinet Office.\nIn Westminster Hall, the first debate (9.30am-11am) is on negotiations on the UK's future Euratom membership - the Labour MP Albert Owen (one of the contenders for the chair of the business and energy select committee) will warn of problems ahead if the UK leaves the EU atomic energy agency without making transitional arrangements to allow for the purchase of nuclear materials and technology from member nations, and maintain monitoring arrangements for British nuclear facilities.\nAn amendment highlighting the possible problems from leaving Euratom as part of the Brexit process did gain some traction during the debates on the bill to invoke Article 50, earlier this year, and Mr Owen anticipates some cross-party support and pressure on the government, during this debate.\nIn the afternoon, the Telford MP, Lucy Allan, leads a debate (2.30pm-4pm) on the challenges facing new towns.\nBut it is the debate on abuse and intimidation of candidates and the public in UK elections (4.30pm-5.30pm) that promises to be the most rancorous of the week. Expect much finger-pointing, with a number of MPs seeking payback for some bruising experiences during the campaign. The debate will be led by the Conservative backbencher, Simon Hart, who says many candidates faced \"numerous acts of vandalism, abuse, intimidation and general thuggishness - especially online\".\nHe wants to use the debate to raise the wider question of the impact of all this on recruitment and retention of candidates, public attitudes to voicing support for individuals, reporting and ultimately electoral outcomes. Intriguingly he also wants to pose the question: \"what is acceptable online activity from opponents in public office?\"\nIn the Lords (3pm) there's an interesting looking question to the Leader of the House from Labour's Lord Soley on proposals \"to create a close and constructive relationship between the House of Lords and the European Parliament\".\nThen peers come to the final frontier, the second reading of the Space Industry Bill - it is less exciting than it sounds; the bill is concerned with providing a legal framework for a projected British spaceport.\nSpace technology is one of the UK's unsung industries, and the government is keen to expand it, by licensing a British spaceport ahead of rival countries like Portugal, which wants a launch facility in the Azores.\nThere are a number of rival sites in Cornwall and Scotland which might become the home for a launch facility, although the vehicles concerned will be aircraft lifting space vehicles to high altitude rather than Cape Canaveral style rockets. Before the election, the Commons Science and Technology Committee had run an inquiry into a draft version of the bill, and now peers will boldly legislate where no peer has legislated before.\nThat is followed by a short debate on risks to NHS sustainability arising from the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union - led by the former health minister, Lord Warner, who resigned the Labour whip in 2015 and now sits as a non-affiliated peer.\nOf course, in the Lords, their select committees are up and running - and their EU Committee meets (at 4pm) with the Secretary of State for Exiting the EU, David Davis, to discuss Brexit, the first round of negotiations, engagement with Parliament, citizens' rights and devolution.\nThe Commons opens (9.30 am) with Transport Questions, which could see the debut of whoever is elected as the new chair of the Transport Select Committee. And then comes the weekly Business Statement from the Leader of the House, Andrea Leadsom.\nThe main debate is a Commemoration of Passchendaele, the third battle of Ypres, one of the bloodiest of the First World War. The figures are disputed but there were an estimated 240,000 British, 8,525 French and 260,000 German casualties. One MP to watch will be the Conservative military historian Keith Simpson, who intends to look at the blunders by the generals who planned the allied offensive.\nExpect a number of MPs to speak about the sacrifices made by their ancestors, and to point to the losses sustained by New Zealand soldiers.\nThe adjournment debate, led by the Conservative, Alec Shelbrooke is on the prosecution of driving offences committed on private land - it follows from the death of nine-year-old Harry Whitlam killed by a drunk driver in a farmyard, in 2015.\nBecause this happened on private land the driver could only be prosecuted under health and safety legislation - and Mr Shelbrooke will be calling for a change in the law.\nIn the Lords (11 am) the Plaid Cymru peer Lord Wigley has a question on the sensitive issue of changes to the Barnett formula for Wales and Scotland arising from additional financial provision for Northern Ireland which follows the government's deal with the Northern Ireland Democratic Unionists.\nA series of Labour backbench debates on public service issues follows, with Baroness Andrews raising the impact of deregulation on public services, health and safety;  Lord Haskel the cap on public sector pay and Lord Kennedy of Southwark on local government finance and arrangements beyond 2020.\nThere's also a short debate on security challenges and related human rights violations on the Korean peninsula led by Lord Alton of Liverpool.\nNeither House sits on Friday.",

    "text": "They have until 23:00 GMT on Monday to sign up or ship out players they will count on between then and May - so who will be the big targets and will the deals go through?\nIN THE FRAME? Newcastle United, Tottenham Hotspur\nWHY? Newcastle - who have made a \u00a321m bid - are desperate to add firepower in an attempt to push themselves up the table and, for all his fragile relationship with West Brom chairman Jeremy Peace since a move to Spurs fell down in August, Berahino brings goals.\nSpurs' need is not so desperate but history suggests he is a player manager Mauricio Pochettino rates as potential support for Harry Kane, who Berahino has partnered for England U21s.\nHOW MUCH WILL HE COST? \u00a325m.\nWHERE WILL HE FIT IN? He is a young player with pace and an ability to become a regular goalscorer - important assets for any team. He scored 14 league goals for the Baggies last season and was central to their survival and has 22 goals in 88 Premier League games in all.\nAt Newcastle he would become a focal point alongside 21-year-old Aleksandar Mitrovic. At Spurs he would lend valuable support to Kane but also provide a danger with his ability to drop deep.\nWILL IT HAPPEN? May go down to the wire and no-one should expect the tough negotiator Peace to offer any bargains to potential suitors - August demonstrated he will not be railroaded into doing business. Newcastle could also find Peace unwilling to do a deal that would considerably strengthen a close rival. And of course Spurs love a late deal.\nIN THE FRAME? Liverpool, Chelsea\nWHY? A late developer, the 26-year-old Brazilian has scored 22 goals in 15 league games and four in 10 Champions League games for Ukrainian side Shakhtar this season, attracting attention from major clubs elsewhere in Europe.\nLiverpool have scored just 30 goals in 23 Premier League games this season and with Daniel Sturridge more or less a permanent spectator and doubts about whether \u00a332.5m summer signing Christian Benteke fits manager Jurgen Klopp's high-intensity pressing style, their situation has become urgent.\nHOW MUCH WILL HE COST? Shakhtar say Teixeira has a \u00a353.2m buyout clause in his contract - higher than an original \u00a338m valuation. Liverpool have so far only offered \u00a324m with \u00a33m in add-ons according to Shakhtar chief executive Sergei Palkin - hence no deal so far.\nWHERE WILL HE FIT IN? Teixeira will fit the Klopp template, mobile and busy as part of an attacking spearhead with the likes of fellow Brazilian Roberto Firmino. Would be a big statement of intent and he would have responsibility for solving the goalscoring gap caused by injuries to the likes of Sturridge, Divock Origi and Danny Ings.\nWILL IT HAPPEN? Liverpool chief executive Ian Ayre flew to Shakhtar's winter training camp in Florida to open negotiations and more hard talking needs to be done.\nTeixeira is desperate for the move to go through and join compatriots Philippe Coutinho, Lucas and Firmino in Liverpool's senior ranks, saying: \"I want to be there but that is up to the club president now. I can only hope. I've played with Coutinho since we were 10 and it would be a lot of fun to play with him again.\"\nWhether he gets his wish depends on Liverpool increasing their offer and Shakhtar meeting them somewhere in the middle - but time is against this one.\nIN THE FRAME? Leicester City, Newcastle United\nWHY? Remy is a goalscorer of proven Premier League pedigree who is on the market because of lack of opportunities since his \u00a310.5m move to Chelsea from Queen's Park Rangers in August 2014.\nAs demonstrated by their interest in Berahino, Newcastle manager Steve McClaren wants to add goal threat to his struggling side while Premier League leaders Leicester want to add quality from a position of strength.\nHOW MUCH WILL HE COST? \u00a311.5m.\nWHERE WILL HE FIT IN? At Leicester he would provide support and strength for the speed and mobility of Jamie Vardy and the creativity of Riyad Mahrez.\nRemy would be the spearhead at Newcastle. He is fondly remembered on Tyneside after a successful loan spell from QPR in 2013-14, when he scored 14 goals in 27 appearances. He also has a very respectable overall Premier League record of 28 goals in 71 games.\nWILL IT HAPPEN? There's a good chance he will leave Chelsea, who are ready to accept offers after the loan signing of Alexandre Pato. The price is reasonable by current standards and he would fit the bill for any side seeking goals.\nIN THE FRAME? Everton\nWHY? Everton's problems under Roberto Martinez have been in defence this season but with his attacking resources depleted by the \u00a38.5m sale of Steven Naismith to Norwich City and the failure of Aiden McGeady to make an impact, buying a striker is also under consideration.\nHOW MUCH WILL HE COST? \u00a313.5m\nWHERE WILL HE FIT IN? A player with pace who has scored 12 times in 21 league games this season, Niasse would provide much-needed back-up for Romelu Lukaku, who has been carrying a heavy burden this season.\nWILL IT HAPPEN? Everton have been looking to make a big signing during this transfer window and with Dynamo Kiev's Andriy Yarmolenko out of reach this looks like the one they will be pushing for on deadline day. Expensive for a player with no Premier League experience.\nIN THE FRAME? Aston Villa, Sunderland\nWHY? The 30-year-old France right-back has fallen down the pecking order and been troubled by injury during his time at Arsenal following a \u00a310m move from Newcastle United in 2014. Debuchy has made only two Premier League appearances this season so it makes perfect sense for him to move on.\nHOW MUCH WILL HE COST? Initial loan.\nWHERE WILL HE FIT IN? Aston Villa manager Remi Garde is hoping to clinch a deal that will allow his fellow countryman to add experience at the highest level to a side currently looking certainties for relegation. Sunderland boss Sam Allardyce may be tempted into a late move but Garde will know the player and is currently in pole position.\nWILL IT HAPPEN? There's a strong expectation Debuchy will go before the deadline, with Villa currently favourites.\nIN THE FRAME? Everton, Arsenal, Stoke City\nWHY? A player of proven quality who has been the talisman for Dynamo Kiev in their qualification for the last 16 of the Champions League, where they meet Manchester City. Now looks ready to finally cut his ties with Ukraine, where he is also a key figure for the national side with 22 goals in 55 games.\nHOW MUCH WILL HE COST? \u00a325m\nWHERE WILL HE FIT IN? A gifted, powerful all-purpose attacker. Wonderful left-foot and can operate on both wings and also as a number 10. Trademark has been to cut in from the right and score - as Everton found to their cost in last season's 5-2 thrashing in the Europe League in Kiev.\nEverton boss Martinez has had the player in his sights since then and would use him in the number 10 role. If Arsenal pursue their interest you would imagine his versatility would be ideal there.\nWILL IT HAPPEN? Don't see this unless something very dramatic happens - more likely to happen in the summer. Dynamo Kiev simply blocked Everton when they tried to do a deal in August - and it's hard to see why they would sell now with that Champions League meeting with Manchester City coming up.\nIN THE FRAME? Swansea City\nWHY? The pacy striker is not part of manager Alan Pardew's plans at Crystal Palace this season and has yet to score in the Premier League in the current campaign - but Gayle got 10 in 29 appearances last season and the 26-year-old might just benefit from a change of scenery.\nHOW MUCH WILL HE COST? \u00a37m\nWHERE WILL HE FIT IN? Swansea have been forced to look at strikers because Bafetimbi Gomis' form has faded after a bright start and he would be an energetic partner for Andre Ayew.\nWILL IT HAPPEN? There is a deal to be done there and if Swansea come up with a good offer then do not see Palace resisting too hard on this one.\nIN THE FRAME? Newcastle United\nWHY? Struggled to deliver this season with just five goals in 21 Premier League games and his potential partnership with Andre Ayew has not worked, although the latter has done well. Swansea may be tempted to cash in.\nHOW MUCH WILL HE COST? \u00a37m\nWHERE WILL HE FIT IN? Newcastle United are looking to bring in a striker before the deadline to give them an added dimension - on his day Gomis is a powerful, formidable figure. Just that those days are getting fewer and fewer lately.\nWILL IT HAPPEN? Newcastle are working through a list that also includes Saido Berahino, Loic Remy and Seydou Doumbia -  manager Steve McClaren is understood to want two strikers so Gomis could be a fall-back option.\nIN THE FRAME? Manchester United\nWHY? Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal is short of defensive resources with the likes of Marco Rojo out injured and first-choice left-back Luke Shaw a long-term absentee as he recovers from a broken leg. Rose is not currently Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino's preferred option, with Ben Davies at left-back.\nHOW MUCH WILL HE COST? \u00a36m\nWHERE WILL HE FIT IN? Will fit on the left side of United's defence, where Van Gaal is struggling for experienced personnel.\nWILL IT HAPPEN? Long shot but United are desperate for full-backs. Spurs will not be keen on dealing with a direct rival in this instance but could just get a late deadline day phone call. United have reportedly watched Rose four times recently.\nIN THE FRAME? Arsenal\nWHY? The 19-year-old left-back has barely figured for Leicester but his performances in England's youth teams have marked him out as an almost certain future international.\nHOW MUCH WILL HE COST? \u00a35m\nWHERE WILL HE FIT IN? One for the future. He has also been linked with Liverpool but Arsenal are trying to get in first for a player who could emerge as a threat to Nacho Monreal and England defender Kieran Gibbs.\nWILL IT HAPPEN? Leicester want Chilwell to sign a new contract at the King Power Stadium and stay at a club on the up. Would take a special offer from Arsenal, or indeed anyone else, to persuade the Foxes otherwise.\nMedia playback is not supported on this device",

    "text": "When he lost out to Conservative Craig Mackinlay by almost 3,000 votes, he did indeed announce his intention to quit as leader. But that decision was short-lived - the party refused his resignation - and he remains at the helm of the party he has transformed from a fringe group to a major force in British politics.\nIn 2001, it polled just 1.5% of the national vote and only one candidate kept his deposit. By Friday its share of the vote had risen to almost 13% - some 3.8 million votes - and while the party won only one seat, it came second or third in dozens of others.\nMuch of that success has been driven by media-friendly Mr Farage, a picture editor's dream when snapped grinning with pint or cigarette (sometimes both) in hand.\nHis \"man in the pub\" image and disdain for political correctness left him free to attack rivals for being mechanical and overly on-message. This inspired affection and respect among those who agreed with him on core messages about cutting immigration and leaving the European Union.\nTrue to his image as an outspoken saloon bar philosopher, he got into plenty of fights.\nDuring the general election campaign, it was over TV debate comments he made about migrants using the NHS for expensive HIV treatment. They drew an angry rebuke from Plaid Cymru leader Leanne Wood, who told him: \"You ought to be ashamed of yourself.\"\nBut despite widespread condemnation from opponents, reports quoted UKIP insiders saying the comments - dubbed \"shock and awful\" - were part of a carefully planned move to appeal to the party's base. One senior aide was quoted as saying his remarks would be welcomed by \"millions and millions\" of working-class voters.\nSo how did a stockbroker's son become a mouthpiece for the disaffected working class?\nNigel Paul Farage was born on 3 April 1964 in Kent. His alcoholic father, Guy Oscar Justus Farage, walked out on the family when Nigel was five.\nYet this seemed to do little to damage the youngster's conventional upper-middle-class upbringing. Nigel attended fee-paying Dulwich College, where he developed a love of cricket, rugby and political debate.\nHe decided at the age of 18 not to go to university, entering the City instead.\nWith his gregarious, laddish ways he proved popular among clients and fellow traders on the metals exchange. Mr Farage, who started work just before the \"big bang\" in the City, earned a more-than-comfortable living, but had another calling - politics.\nAge: 51\nFamily: Married with two daughters to Kirsten Mehr. Two grown-up sons with ex-wife\nEducation: Did not attend university after leaving fee-paying Dulwich College at 18\nCareer: City commodities trader from 1982, starting at London Metals Exchange\nPolitical timeline:\nPastimes: Shore fishing, WW1 battlefield tours, Dad's Army, cricket, red wine\nMr Farage joined the Conservatives but became disillusioned with the way the party was going under John Major. Like many on the Eurosceptic wing, he was furious when the prime minister signed the Maastricht Treaty, stipulating an \"ever-closer union\" between European nations.\nMr Farage decided to break away, becoming one of the founder members of the UK Independence Party, at that time known as the Anti-Federalist League.\nIn his early 20s, he had the first of several brushes with death, when he was run over by a car in Orpington, Kent, after a night in the pub. He sustained severe injuries and doctors feared he would lose a leg.  Grainne Hayes, his nurse, became his first wife.\nHe had two sons with Ms Hayes, both now grown up, and two daughters with his current wife, Kirsten Mehr, a German national he married in 1999.\n\"At first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win,\" speaking - after Mahatma Gandhi - in April 2015 about UKIP's election chances\n\"It took me six hours and 15 minutes to get here... because of open-door immigration and the fact that the M4 is not as navigable as it used to be,\" his excuse for being late for a meeting in Wales in December 2014\n\"I want the EU to end but I want it to end democratically. If it doesn't end democratically I'm afraid it will end very unpleasantly,\" during a Euro election debate with Nick Clegg in April 2014\n\"I don't want to be rude... Who are you? I'd never heard of you, nobody in Europe had ever heard of you,\"  his greeting to President of the European Council, Herman Van Rompuy, in February 2010\n\"As... his personal make-up artist straightened his chest hair for him, I kid you not, I realised that perhaps he might be a bit lighter weight than expected,\" - after Question Time with comedian Russell Brand in December 2014\nMonths after recovering from his road accident, Mr Farage was diagnosed with testicular cancer.\nHe made a full recovery, but he says the experience changed him, making him even more determined to make the most of life.\nThe young Farage might have had energy and enthusiasm to spare - but his early electoral forays with UKIP proved frustrating.\nAt the 1997 general election, it was overshadowed by the Referendum Party, backed by multimillionaire businessman Sir James Goldsmith.\nBut as the Referendum Party faded, UKIP started to take up some of its hardcore anti-EU support.\nIn 1999, it saw its first electoral breakthrough - thanks to the introduction of proportional representation for European elections, which made it easier for smaller parties to gain seats.\nMr Farage was one of three UKIP members voted in to the European Parliament, representing South East England.\nThe decision to take up seats in Brussels sparked one of many splits in the UKIP ranks - they were proving to be a rancorous bunch.\nMr Farage scored a publicity coup by recruiting former TV presenter and ex-Labour MP Robert Kilroy-Silk to be a candidate in the 2004 European elections, but the plan backfired when Mr Kilroy-Silk attempted to take over the party.\nIt was a turbulent time for UKIP but in that year's elections it had increased its number of MEPs to 12.\nIn 2006, Mr Farage was elected leader, replacing the less flamboyant Roger Knapman.\nHe was already a fierce critic of Conservative leader David Cameron, who earlier that year had described UKIP members as \"fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists\".\nMr Farage told the press that \"nine out of 10\" Tories agreed with his party's views on Europe.\nAsked if UKIP was declaring war on the Conservatives, he said: \"It is a war between UKIP and the entire political establishment.\"\n\"We Tories look at him, with his pint and cigar and sense of humour, and instinctively recognise someone fundamentally indistinguishable from us,\" London Mayor Boris Johnson in 2013\n\"This man is not a cartoon character, he isn't Del Boy or Arthur Daley, he's a pound shop Enoch Powell and we're watching him,\" Russell Brand on Question Time in 2014\n\"He's a really, really reem guy... It means cool, wicked, sick.\" Reality TV star Joey Essex during the 2015 election campaign\n\"You are either serious or a kind of Victor Meldrew on stilts. Which one are you?\" Nick Clegg in 2015\n\"He's very outspoken - even the people who don't share his message think that he's a great speaker and fun to listen to.\" Timo Soini, of the eurosceptic True Finns party\nAt the 2009 European elections, with Mr Farage becoming a regular fixture on TV discussion programmes, UKIP got more votes than Labour and the Lib Dems, and increased its number of MEPs to 13.\nBut the party knew it could do little to bring about its goal of getting Britain out of the EU from Brussels and Strasbourg - and it had always performed poorly in UK domestic elections.\nIn an effort to change this, Mr Farage resigned as leader in 2009 to contest the Buckingham seat held by House of Commons Speaker John Bercow.\nHe gained widespread publicity in March 2010 - two months before the election - when he launched an attack in the European Parliament on the president of the European Council, Herman van Rompuy, accusing him of having \"the charisma of a damp rag\" and \"the appearance of a low-grade bank clerk\".\nIt raised Mr Farage's profile, going viral on the internet, but made little difference to his Westminster ambitions. He came third, behind Mr Bercow and an independent candidate.\nMr Farage's chosen successor as leader, Lord Pearson of Rannoch, was not suited to the cut-and-thrust of modern political debate and presentation, and UKIP polled just 3.1% nationally.\nBut there was a far greater personal disaster. On the day of the election an aeroplane carrying Mr Farage crashed after a UKIP-supporting banner became entangled in the tail fin.\nHe was dragged from the wreckage with serious injuries.\nAfter recovering in hospital, he told the London Evening Standard the experience had changed him: \"I think it's made me more 'me' than I was before, to be honest. Even more fatalistic.\n\"Even more convinced it's not a dress rehearsal. Even more driven than I was before. And I am driven.\"\nMr Farage decided he wanted to become leader again and was easily voted back after Lord Pearson resigned.\nEurope, and particularly migration to the UK from EU countries, has been a growing political issue since the enlargement of 2004.\nMr Farage increased UKIP's focus on the immigration impact of EU membership, referring to Britain's \"open door\" causing congestion on the M4, a Romanian crime wave in London and a shortage of housing, healthcare, school places and jobs for young people.\nIt led to repeated accusations of racism, described by Mr Farage as \"grossly unfair\". His strategy had long been to distance the party from the far right - its constitution bans former BNP members from joining.\nRather, he aimed to be seen as tribune for the disenfranchised, not just the older, comfortably off middle classes alienated by rapid social change caused by mass immigration, but working-class voters left behind in the hunt for jobs and seemingly ignored by the increasingly professionalised \"political class\".\nDespite facing vocal protests, including taking refuge from Scottish nationalists in one Edinburgh pub in 2013 and being chased by \"diversity\" activists from another in London in 2015, his efforts saw UKIP's influence increase.\nAfter winning more than 140 English council seats at the 2013 local election - averaging 25% of the vote in the wards where it was standing - it gained 161 last year.\nMore significantly, the party won the UK's European election outright, gaining 27.5% of the vote. Its momentum then built when Tory defector Douglas Carswell forced a by-election to secure UKIP's first parliamentary seat, with colleague Mark Reckless following suit shortly afterwards.\nWhile polls charted a steady decline in UKIP support through 2015, commentators noted an unusual lack of energy from its leader and questioned whether he was fit for the fight.\nIt prompted Mr Farage to reveal he'd been in \"a great deal of pain\" at the start of the campaign, having neglected a chronic back condition caused by his plane crash. Despite physiotherapy helping his energy levels return, he never made the impact some thought he might.\nComments ahead of polling day that UKIP was \"about a lot more than me\", and that he was \"a complete convert\" to proportional representation, hinted that he believed the game was up.\nDespite gaining 13% of the vote at the general election, with nearly four million people casting a ballot for the party, they only managed to return one MP, Douglas Carswell, with Mark Reckless losing his seat.\nMr Farage failed in his bid to win South Thanet, which was retained by the Conservatives.\nHe announced his resignation as party leader on the morning after polling day, but left the door open for a possible return by saying he might stand in the leadership contest after he had had the summer off.\nThen he surprised some in the party by announcing that he had changed his mind after being \"persuaded\" by \"overwhelming\" evidence from UKIP members that they wanted him to remain leader.\nThis triggered a civil war at the top of the party, with MEP Patrick O'Flynn saying in an article in the Times that Mr Farage had become a \"snarling, thin-skinned, aggressive\" man who is making UKIP look like an \"absolutist monarchy or a personality cult\" and others calling for a leadership contest.\nAdd to that a row between Mr Carswell and Mr Farage over whether the party should accept the \u00a3650,000 in public funds it is entitled to as an opposition party in the Commons and UKIP is starting to look like a party in crisis.\nIt is not the first time Mr Farage has faced claims from current and former party colleagues that he is too dictatorial.\nFormer MEP Godfrey Bloom, Mr Farage's former Brussels flatmate, who resigned the UKIP whip after a string of controversies, told BBC News he was not a \"team player\".\nMr Farage himself has often spoken about how the party needs to stop being a one-man band in the eyes of the public.\nHe has pushed other figures, such as deputy chairman Suzanne Evans and deputy leader Paul Nuttall, into the spotlight.\nBut for the millions who voted for UKIP in the general election, Nigel Farage is UKIP.\nFew politicians have been more closely identified with the party they lead.\nAnd with a referendum on Britain's membership of the EU on the horizon, that situation is likely to continue for the foreseeable future.",
    "summary": "On the eve of polling day, UKIP leader Nigel Farage told interviewers he would be \"for the chop\" if he failed to get elected in the Kent seat of South Thanet."
